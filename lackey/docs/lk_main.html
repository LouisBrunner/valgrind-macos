<h2>1&nbsp; Lackey</h2>

Lackey is a simple Valgrind tool that does some basic program measurement.
It adds quite a lot of simple instrumentation to the program's code.  It is
primarily intended to be of use as an example tool.
<p>
It measures three things:

<ol>
<li>The number of calls to <code>_dl_runtime_resolve()</code>, the function
    in glibc's dynamic linker that resolves function lookups into shared 
    objects.<p>

<li>The number of UCode instructions (UCode is Valgrind's RISC-like
    intermediate language), x86 instructions, and basic blocks executed by the
    program, and some ratios between the three counts.<p>

<li>The number of conditional branches encountered and the proportion of those
    taken.<p>
</ol>
