This file documents various "processes" that are used by Valgrind
developers for development and release activities.
This file contains one section for each process.
A summary of each process is given here. Each process is described
more in details afterwards.


* Update of the NEWS file: NEWS describes fixed bugs and new features.
  It is updated and committed together with the code fixing the bug/implementing
  the feature.

* Major release production: 
  See docs/internals/release-HOWTO.txt (currently a bit out of date)

* Various guidelines/recommended usage for valgrind GIT
  See docs/internals/git-HOWTO.txt

* Minor/correction release production: TBD


Processes detailed descriptions:

Update of the NEWS file.
========================
  The NEWS file gives for each release:
    - the list of fixed bugs,
    - a short description of each functional change,
    - a short description of each technical change impacting the users.
  
  The update of the NEWS file should be committed together with the
  code change (or as part of the last committed change) that fixes the
  bug or implements the new feature/technical change.
  The documentation (e.g. user manual) should also be committed as part of
  the code change.

  Fixing a bug
  ------------
  When fixing a bug, add a line in the 'FIXED BUGS' section of
  the NEWS file.  Keep the list of bugs sorted by bugzilla entry number.

  Once you have commit the change, update the bug status in bugzilla,
  adding in the comment the revision number of the commit fixing the bug.

  If a bug is not entered in bugzilla (not encouraged), use "n-i-bz"
  and add the bug line at the end of the bug list.

  The file docs/internals/X_Y_BUGSTATUS.txt (where X_Y is the last
  major release e.g. 3_9) contains information/statuses for some bugs.
  If a bug is fixed, remove the (possible) bug info from this file.

  Implementing a change
  ---------------------
  When implementing a functional or 'user impacting' technical change,
  add a short description of the change in the relevant sub-section
  (e.g. TOOL CHANGES, PLATFORM CHANGES, ...).


  Some special cases:
  -------------------
  Some changes or bug fixes are very big and might be implemented over
  a significant period. In such a case, update the NEWS as part of the
  final commit.
  If relevant, you might already update the NEWS file as part of
  earlier commits, using the word 'PARTIAL' to indicate that the change or
  bug fix is not complete yet.

  Some bugs are reported more than once in bugzilla.
  Also document in NEWS that such duplicated bugs have been fixed, using a line
  such as:
     308333 == 307106
  to indicate that the bug 308333 is a duplicate of 307106, and was thus
  fixed in the commit that fixed 307106.
  Change also the status of the duplicated bug  in bugzilla,
  indicating in the comment the commit revision that fixed the 'master bug'.
