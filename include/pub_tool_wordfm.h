/* As of r7409 (15 Feb 08), all these word-based abstractions (WordFM,
   WordSet, WordBag) now operate on unsigned words (UWord), whereas
   they previously operated on signed words (Word).  This became a
   problem, when using unboxed comparisons (when kCmp == NULL), with
   the introduction of VG_(initIterAtFM), which allows iteration over
   parts of mappings.  Iterating over a mapping in increasing order of
   signed Word keys is not what callers expect when iterating through
   maps whose keys represent addresses (Addr) since Addr is unsigned,
   and causes logical problems and assertion failures. */
