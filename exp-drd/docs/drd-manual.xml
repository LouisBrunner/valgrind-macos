<title>Background</title>

<para>
DRD is a Valgrind tool for detecting errors in multithreaded C and C++
shared-memory programs. The tool works for any program that uses the
POSIX threading primitives or that uses threading concepts built on
top of the POSIX threading primitives.

<title>Multithreaded Programming Paradigms</title>

<para>
For many applications multithreading is a necessity. There are two
reasons why the use of threads may be required:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      To model concurrent activities. Managing the state of one
      activity per thread can be a great simplification compared to
      multiplexing the states of multiple activities in a single
      thread. This is why most server and embedded software is
      multithreaded.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      To let computations run on multiple CPU cores
      simultaneously. This is why many High Performance Computing
      (HPC) applications are multithreaded.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Multithreaded programs can use one or more of the following
paradigms. Which paradigm is appropriate a.o. depends on the
application type -- modeling concurrent activities versus HPC.
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Locking. Data that is shared between threads may only be
      accessed after a lock is obtained on the mutex associated with
      the shared data item.  A.o. the POSIX threads library, the Qt
      library and the Boost.Thread library support this paradigm
      directly.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Message passing. No data is shared between threads, but threads
      exchange data by passing messages to each other. Well known
      implementations of the message passing paradigm are MPI and
      CORBA.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Software Transactional Memory (STM). Data is shared between
      threads, and shared data is updated via transactions. After each
      transaction it is verified whether there were conflicting
      transactions. If there were conflicts, the transaction is
      aborted, otherwise it is committed. This is a so-called
      optimistic approach. There is a prototype of the Intel C
      Compiler (<computeroutput>icc</computeroutput>) available that
      supports STM. Research is ongoing about the addition of STM
      support to <computeroutput>gcc</computeroutput>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Automatic parallelization. A compiler converts a sequential
      program into a multithreaded program. The original program may
      or may not contain parallelization hints. As an example,
      <computeroutput>gcc</computeroutput> supports OpenMP from
      version 4.3.0 on. OpenMP is a set of compiler directives which
      tell a compiler how to parallelize a C, C++ or Fortran program.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
DRD supports any combination of multithreaded programming paradigms as
long as the implementation of these paradigms is based on the POSIX
threads primitives. DRD however does not support programs that use
e.g. Linux' futexes directly. Attempts to analyze such programs with
DRD will result in false positives.

<title>POSIX Threads Programming Model</title>

<para>
POSIX threads, also known as Pthreads, is the most widely available
threading library on Unix systems.
</para>

<para>
The POSIX threads programming model is based on the following abstractions:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      A shared address space. All threads running within the same
      process share the same address space. All data, whether shared or
      not, is identified by its address.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Regular load and store operations, which allow to read values
      from or to write values to the memory shared by all threads
      running in the same process.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Atomic store and load-modify-store operations. While these
      are not mentioned in the POSIX threads standard, most
      microprocessors support atomic memory operations. And some
      compilers provide direct support for atomic memory operations
      through built-in functions like
      e.g. <computeroutput>__sync_fetch_and_add()</computeroutput>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Threads. Each thread represents a concurrent activity.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>

      Synchronization objects and operations on these synchronization
      objects. The following types of synchronization objects are
      defined in the POSIX threads standard: mutexes, condition
      variables, semaphores, reader-writer locks, barriers and
      spinlocks.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Which source code statements generate which memory accesses depends on
the memory model of the programming language being used. There is not
yet a definitive memory model for the C and C++ languagues. For a

<sect2 id="drd-manual.mt-problems" xreflabel="MT-Problems">
<title>Multithreaded Programming Problems</title>

<para>
Depending on how multithreading is expressed in a program, one or more
of the following problems can be triggered by a multithreaded program:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Data races. One or more threads access the same memory
      location without sufficient locking.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Lock contention. One thread blocks the progress of one or more other
      threads by holding a lock too long.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Improper use of the POSIX threads API. The most popular POSIX
      threads implementation, NPTL, is optimized for speed. The NPTL
      will not complain on certain errors, e.g. when a mutex is locked
      in one thread and unlocked in another thread.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Deadlock. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads wait for
      each other indefinitely.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      False sharing. If threads that run on different processor cores
      access different variables located in the same cache line
      frequently, this will slow down the involved threads a lot due
      to frequent exchange of cache lines.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Although the likelihood of the occurrence of data races can be reduced
by a disciplined programming style, a tool for automatic detection of
data races is a necessity when developing multithreaded software. DRD
can detect these, as well as lock contention and improper use of the
POSIX threads API.
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 id="drd-manual.drd-versus-helgrind" xreflabel="DRD-versus-Helgrind">
<title>Data Race Detection by DRD versus Helgrind</title>

<para>
Synchronization operations impose an order on interthread memory
accesses. This order is also known as the happens-before relationship.
</para>

<para>
A multithreaded program is data-race free if all interthread memory
accesses are ordered by synchronization operations.
</para>

<para>
A well known way to ensure that a multithreaded program is data-race
free is to ensure that a locking discipline is followed. It is e.g.
possible to associate a mutex with each shared data item, and to hold
a lock on the associated mutex while the shared data is accessed.
</para>

<para>
All programs that follow a locking discipline are data-race free, but
not all data-race free programs follow a locking discipline. There
exist multithreaded programs where access to shared data is arbitrated
via condition variables, semaphores or barriers. As an example, a
certain class of HPC applications consists of a sequence of
computation steps separated in time by barriers, and where these
barriers are the only means of synchronization.
</para>

<para>
There exist two different algorithms for verifying the correctness of
multithreaded programs at runtime. The so-called Eraser algorithm
verifies whether all shared memory accesses follow a consistent
locking strategy. And the happens-before data race detectors verify
directly whether all interthread memory accesses are ordered by
synchronization operations. While the happens-before data race
detection algorithm is more complex to implement, and while it is more
sensitive to OS scheduling, it is a general approach that works for
all classes of multithreaded programs. Furthermore, the happens-before
data race detection algorithm does not report any false positives.
</para>

<para>
DRD is based on the happens-before algorithm, while Helgrind uses a
variant of the Eraser algorithm.

<para>
DRD prints a message every time it detects a data race. You should be
aware of the following when interpreting DRD's output:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Every thread is assigned two <emphasis>thread ID's</emphasis>:
      one thread ID is assigned by the Valgrind core and one thread ID
      is assigned by DRD. Both thread ID's start at one. Valgrind
      thread ID's are reused when one thread finishes and another
      thread is created. DRD does not reuse thread ID's. Thread ID's
      are displayed e.g. as follows: 2/3, where the first number is
      Valgrind's thread ID and the second number is the thread ID
      assigned by DRD.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The term <emphasis>segment</emphasis> refers to a consecutive
      sequence of load, store and synchronization operations, all
      issued by the same thread. A segment always starts and ends at a
      synchronization operation. Data race analysis is performed
      between segments instead of between individual load and store
      operations because of performance reasons.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      There are always at least two memory accesses involved in a data
      race. Memory accesses involved in a data race are called
      <emphasis>conflicting memory accesses</emphasis>. DRD prints a
      report for each memory access that conflicts with a past memory
      access.

<para>
The above report has the following meaning:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The number in the column on the left is the process ID of the
      process being analyzed by DRD.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The first line ("Thread 3") tells you Valgrind's thread ID for
      the thread in which context the data race was detected.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The next line tells which kind of operation was performed (load
      or store) and by which thread. Both Valgrind's and DRD's thread
      ID's are displayed. On the same line the start address and the
      number of bytes involved in the conflicting access are also
      displayed.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Next, the call stack of the conflicting access is displayed. If
      your program has been compiled with debug information (-g), this
      call stack will include file names and line numbers. The two
      bottommost frames in this call stack (<function>clone</function>
      and <function>start_thread</function>) show how the NPTL starts a
      thread. The third frame (<function>vg_thread_wrapper</function>)
      is added by DRD. The fourth frame
      (<function>thread_func</function>) is interesting because it
      shows the thread entry point, that is the function that has been
      passed as the third argument to
      <function>pthread_create()</function>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Next, the allocation context for the conflicting address is
      displayed. For static and stack variables the allocation context
      is only shown when the option
      <computeroutput>--var-info=yes</computeroutput> has been
      specified. Otherwise DRD will print <computeroutput>Allocation
      context: unknown</computeroutput> for such variables.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      A conflicting access involves at least two memory accesses. For
      one of these accesses an exact call stack is displayed, and for
      the other accesses an approximate call stack is displayed,
      namely the start and the end of the segments of the other
      accesses. This information can be interpreted as follows:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Start at the bottom of both call stacks, and count the
            number stack frames with identical function name, file
            name and line number. In the above example the three
            bottommost frames are identical
            (<function>clone</function>,
            <function>start_thread</function> and
            <function>vg_thread_wrapper</function>).

        </listitem>
        <listitem>

<title>Lock Contention</title>

<para>
Threads should be able to make progress without being blocked by other
threads.  Unfortunately this is not always true.  Sometimes a thread
has to wait until a mutex or reader-writer lock is unlocked by another
thread. This is called <emphasis>lock contention</emphasis>. The more
granular the locks are, the less likely lock contention will
occur. The most unfortunate situation occurs when I/O is performed
while a lock is held.
</para>

<para>
Lock contention causes delays and hence should be avoided. The two
command line options
<literal>--exclusive-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</literal> and
<literal>--shared-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</literal> make it possible to
detect lock contention by making DRD report any lock that is held
longer than the specified threshold. An example:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
$ valgrind --tool=exp-drd --exclusive-threshold=10 exp-drd/tests/hold_lock -i 500

...
]]></programlisting>

<para>
The <literal>hold_lock</literal> test program holds a lock as long as
specified by the <literal>-i</literal> (interval) argument. The DRD
output reports that the lock acquired at line 51 in source file
<literal>hold_lock.c</literal> and released at line 55 was held during
503 ms, while a threshold of 10 ms was specified to DRD.

<para>
There is one message that needs further explanation, namely sending a
signal to a condition variable while no lock is held on the mutex
associated with the signal. Consider e.g. the example <xref
linkend="Racy use of pthread_cond_wait()"></xref>. In this example the
code in thread 1 passes if <literal>flag != 0</literal>, or waits
until it has been signaled by thread 2. If however the code of thread
1 is scheduled after the <literal>pthread_mutex_unlock()</literal>
call in thread 2 and before thread 2 calls
<literal>pthread_cond_signal()</literal>, thread 1 will block
indefinitely. The code in the example <xref linkend="Correct use of
pthread_cond_wait()"></xref> never blocks indefinitely.
</para>

<para>
Because most calls of <function>pthread_cond_signal()</function> or
<function>pthread_cond_broadcast()</function> while no lock is held on
the mutex associated with the condition variable are racy, by default
DRD reports such calls.

The interface between client programs and the DRD tool is defined in

      e.g. applications where the same value is assigned to a shared

<sect2 id="drd-manual.openmp" xreflabel="OpenMP">
<title>Debugging OpenMP Programs With DRD</title>

<para>
OpenMP stands for <emphasis>Open Multi-Processing</emphasis>. The
OpenMP standard consists of a set of compiler directives for C, C++
and Fortran programs that allows a compiler to transform a sequential
program into a parallel program. OpenMP is well suited for HPC
applications and allows to work at a higher level compared to direct
use of the POSIX threads API. While OpenMP ensures that the POSIX API
is used correctly, OpenMP programs can still contain data races. So it
makes sense to verify OpenMP programs with a thread checking tool.
</para>

<para>
DRD supports OpenMP shared-memory programs generated by gcc. The gcc
compiler supports OpenMP since version 4.2.0.  Gcc's runtime support
for OpenMP programs is provided by a library called
<literal>libgomp</literal>. The synchronization primites implemented
in this library use Linux' futex system call directly, unless the
library has been configured with the
<literal>--disable-linux-futex</literal> flag. DRD only supports
libgomp libraries that have been configured with this flag and in
which symbol information is present. For most Linux distributions this
means that you will have to recompile gcc. See also the script
<literal>exp-drd/scripts/download-and-build-gcc</literal> in the
Valgrind source tree for an example of how to compile gcc. You will
also have to make sure that the newly compiled
<literal>libgomp.so</literal> library is loaded when OpenMP programs
are started. This is possible by adding a line similar to the
following to your shell startup script:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/gcc-4.3.1/lib64:~/gcc-4.3.1/lib:
]]></programlisting>

<para>
As an example, the test OpenMP test program
<literal>exp-drd/scripts/omp_matinv</literal> triggers a data race
when the option -r has been specified on the command line. The data
race is triggered by the following code:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
#pragma omp parallel for private(j)
for (j = 0; j < rows; j++)
{
  if (i != j)
  {
    const elem_t factor = a[j * cols + i];
    for (k = 0; k < cols; k++)
    {
      a[j * cols + k] -= a[i * cols + k] * factor;
    }
  }
}
]]></programlisting>

<para>
The above code is racy because the variable <literal>k</literal> has
not been declared private. DRD will print the following error message
for the above code:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

]]></programlisting>
<para>
In the above output the function name <function>gj.omp_fn.0</function>
has been generated by gcc from the function name
<function>gj</function>. Unfortunately the variable name
(<literal>k</literal>) is not shown as the allocation context -- it is
not clear to me whether this is caused by Valgrind or whether this is
caused by gcc. The most usable information in the above output is the
source file name and the line number where the data race has been detected
(<literal>omp_matinv.c:203</literal>).
</para>

<para>
Note: DRD reports errors on the <literal>libgomp</literal> library
included with gcc 4.2.0 up to and including 4.3.1. This might indicate
a race condition in the POSIX version of <literal>libgomp</literal>.
