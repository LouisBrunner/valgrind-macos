/* A structure to hold an ELF/MachO symbol (very crudely).  Usually
   the symbol only has one name, which is stored in ::pri_name, and
   ::sec_names is NULL.  If there are other names, these are stored in
   ::sec_names, which is a NULL terminated vector holding the names.
   The vector is allocated in VG_AR_DINFO, the names themselves live
   in DebugInfo::strpool.

   From the point of view of ELF, the primary vs secondary distinction
   is artificial: they are all just names associated with the address,
   none of which has higher precedence than any other.  However, from
   the point of view of mapping an address to a name to display to the
   user, we need to choose one "preferred" name, and so that might as
   well be installed as the pri_name, whilst all others can live in
   sec_names[].  This has the convenient side effect that, in the
   common case where there is only one name for the address,
   sec_names[] does not need to be allocated.

/* --------------------- CF INFO --------------------- */

/* DiCfSI: a structure to summarise DWARF2/3 CFA info for the code
   address range [base .. base+len-1].

   On x86 and amd64 ("IA"), if you know ({e,r}sp, {e,r}bp, {e,r}ip) at
   some point and {e,r}ip is in the range [base .. base+len-1], it
   tells you how to calculate ({e,r}sp, {e,r}bp) for the caller of the
   current frame and also ra, the return address of the current frame.

   First off, calculate CFA, the Canonical Frame Address, thusly:

     cfa = case cfa_how of
              CFIC_IA_SPREL -> {e,r}sp + cfa_off
              CFIC_IA_BPREL -> {e,r}bp + cfa_off
              CFIC_EXPR     -> expr whose index is in cfa_off

   Once that is done, the previous frame's {e,r}sp/{e,r}bp values and
   this frame's {e,r}ra value can be calculated like this:

     old_{e,r}sp/{e,r}bp/ra
         = case {e,r}sp/{e,r}bp/ra_how of
              CFIR_UNKNOWN   -> we don't know, sorry
              CFIR_SAME      -> same as it was before (sp/fp only)
              CFIR_CFAREL    -> cfa + sp/bp/ra_off
              CFIR_MEMCFAREL -> *( cfa + sp/bp/ra_off )
              CFIR_EXPR      -> expr whose index is in sp/bp/ra_off

   On ARM it's pretty much the same, except we have more registers to
   keep track of:

     cfa = case cfa_how of
              CFIC_ARM_R13REL -> r13 + cfa_off
              CFIC_ARM_R12REL -> r12 + cfa_off
              CFIC_ARM_R11REL -> r11 + cfa_off
              CFIC_ARM_R7REL  -> r7  + cfa_off
              CFIR_EXPR       -> expr whose index is in cfa_off

     old_r14/r13/r12/r11/r7/ra
         = case r14/r13/r12/r11/r7/ra_how of
              CFIR_UNKNOWN   -> we don't know, sorry
              CFIR_SAME      -> same as it was before (r14/r13/r12/r11/r7 only)
              CFIR_CFAREL    -> cfa + r14/r13/r12/r11/r7/ra_off
              CFIR_MEMCFAREL -> *( cfa + r14/r13/r12/r11/r7/ra_off )
              CFIR_EXPR      -> expr whose index is in r14/r13/r12/r11/r7/ra_off

   On ARM64:

     cfa = case cfa_how of
              CFIC_ARM64_SPREL  -> sp + cfa_off
              CFIC_ARM64_X29REL -> x29 + cfa_off
              CFIC_EXPR         -> expr whose index is in cfa_off

     old_sp/x30/x29/ra
         = case sp/x30/x29/ra_how of
              CFIR_UNKNOWN   -> we don't know, sorry
              CFIR_SAME      -> same as it was before
              CFIR_CFAREL    -> cfa + sp/x30/x29/ra_how
              CFIR_MEMCFAREL -> *( cfa + sp/x30/x29/ra_how )
              CFIR_EXPR      -> expr whose index is in sp/x30/x29/ra_off

   On s390x we have a similar logic as x86 or amd64. We need the stack pointer
   (r15), the frame pointer r11 (like BP) and together with the instruction
   address in the PSW we can calculate the previous values:
     cfa = case cfa_how of
              CFIC_IA_SPREL -> r15 + cfa_off
              CFIC_IA_BPREL -> r11 + cfa_off
              CFIC_EXPR     -> expr whose index is in cfa_off

     old_sp/fp/ra
         = case sp/fp/ra_how of
              CFIR_UNKNOWN   -> we don't know, sorry
              CFIR_SAME      -> same as it was before (sp/fp only)
              CFIR_CFAREL    -> cfa + sp/fp/ra_off
              CFIR_MEMCFAREL -> *( cfa + sp/fp/ra_off )
              CFIR_EXPR      -> expr whose index is in sp/fp/ra_off
              CFIR_S390X_F0  -> old value of %f0
              CFIR_S390X_F1  -> old value of %f1
              CFIR_S390X_F2  -> old value of %f2
              CFIR_S390X_F3  -> old value of %f3
              CFIR_S390X_F4  -> old value of %f4
              CFIR_S390X_F5  -> old value of %f5
              CFIR_S390X_F6  -> old value of %f6
              CFIR_S390X_F7  -> old value of %f7

/* --------------------- DEBUGINFO --------------------- */

/* This is the top-level data type.  It's a structure which contains
   information pertaining to one mapped ELF object.  This type is
   exported only abstractly - in pub_tool_debuginfo.h. */

/* First though, here's an auxiliary data structure.  It is only ever
   used as part of a struct _DebugInfo.  We use it to record
   observations about mappings and permission changes to the
   associated file, so as to decide when to read debug info.  It's
   essentially an ultra-trivial finite state machine which, when it
   reaches an accept state, signals that we should now read debug info
   from the object into the associated struct _DebugInfo.  The accept
   state is arrived at when have_rx_map is true and rw_map_count
   is 1 or 2.  The initial state is one in which we have no observations,
   so have_rx_map is false and rw_map_count is 0.

   This all started as a rather ad-hoc solution, but was further
   expanded to handle weird object layouts, e.g. more than one rw
   or rx mapping for one binary.

   The normal sequence of events is one of

   start  -->  r-x mapping  -->  rw- mapping  -->  accept
   start  -->  rw- mapping  -->  r-x mapping  -->  accept

   that is, take the first r-x and rw- mapping we see, and we're done.

   On MacOSX >= 10.7, 32-bit, there appears to be a new variant:

   start  -->  r-- mapping  -->  rw- mapping  
          -->  upgrade r-- mapping to r-x mapping  -->  accept

   where the upgrade is done by a call to mach_vm_protect (OSX 10.7)
   or kernelrpc_mach_vm_protect_trap (OSX 10.9 and possibly 10.8).
   Hence we need to also track this possibility.

   From perusal of dyld sources, it appears that this scheme could
   also be used 64 bit libraries, although that doesn't seem to happen
   in practice.  dyld uses this scheme when the text section requires
   relocation, which only appears to be the case for 32 bit objects.

      Comment_on_IMPORTANT_CFSI_REPRESENTATIONAL_INVARIANTS: we require that
 
      either (size of all rx maps == 0 && cfsi == NULL) (the degenerate case)

      or the normal case, which is the AND of the following:
      (0) size of at least one rx mapping > 0
      (1) no two non-archived DebugInfos with some rx mapping of size > 0
          have overlapping rx mappings
      (2) Each address in [cfsi_minavma,cfsi_maxavma] is in an rx mapping
          or else no cfsi can cover this address.
          The typical case is a single rx mapping covering the full range.
          In some cases, the union of several rx mappings covers the range,
          with possibly some holes between the rx mappings, and no cfsi fall
          within such an hole.
      (3) all DiCfSI in the cfsi array all have ranges that fall within
          [avma,+size) of that rx mapping.
      (4) all DiCfSI in the cfsi array are non-overlapping

      The cumulative effect of these restrictions is to ensure that
      all the DiCfSI records in the entire system are non overlapping.
      Hence any address falls into either exactly one DiCfSI record,
      or none.  Hence it is safe to cache the results of searches for
      DiCfSI records.  This is the whole point of these restrictions.
      The caching of DiCfSI searches is done in VG_(use_CF_info).  The
      cache is flushed after any change to debugInfo_list.  DiCfSI
      searches are cached because they are central to stack unwinding
      on amd64-linux.

      Where are these invariants imposed and checked?

      They are checked after a successful read of debuginfo into
      a DebugInfo*, in check_CFSI_related_invariants.

      (1) is not really imposed anywhere.  We simply assume that the
      kernel will not map the text segments from two different objects
      into the same space.  Sounds reasonable.

      (2) follows from (4) and (3).  It is ensured by canonicaliseCFI.
      (3) is ensured by ML_(addDiCfSI).
      (4) is ensured by canonicaliseCFI.

      --------------------------------------------------------

      Comment_on_DEBUG_SVMA_and_DEBUG_BIAS_fields:

      The _debug_{svma,bias} fields were added as part of a fix to
      #185816.  The problem encompassed in that bug report was that it
      wasn't correct to use apply the bias values deduced for a
      primary object to its associated debuginfo object, because the
      debuginfo object (or the primary) could have been prelinked to a
      different SVMA.  Hence debuginfo and primary objects need to
      have their own biases.

      ------ JRS: (referring to r9329): ------
      Let me see if I understand the workings correctly.  Initially
      the _debug_ values are set to the same values as the "normal"
      ones, as there's a bunch of bits of code like this (in
      readelf.c)

         di->text_svma = svma;
         ...
         di->text_bias = rx_bias;
         di->text_debug_svma = svma;
         di->text_debug_bias = rx_bias;

      If a debuginfo object subsequently shows up then the
      _debug_svma/bias are set for the debuginfo object.  Result is
      that if there's no debuginfo object then the values are the same
      as the primary-object values, and if there is a debuginfo object
      then they will (or at least may) be different.

      Then when we need to actually bias something, we'll have to
      decide whether to use the primary bias or the debuginfo bias.
      And the strategy is to use the primary bias for ELF symbols but
      the debuginfo bias for anything pulled out of Dwarf.

      ------ THH: ------
      Correct - the debug_svma and bias values apply to any address
      read from the debug data regardless of where that debug data is
      stored and the other values are used for addresses from other
      places (primarily the symbol table).

      ------ JRS: ------ 
      Ok; so this was my only area of concern.  Are there any
      corner-case scenarios where this wouldn't be right?  It sounds
      like we're assuming the ELF symbols come from the primary object
      and, if there is a debug object, then all the Dwarf comes from
      there.  But what if (eg) both symbols and Dwarf come from the
      debug object?  Is that even possible or allowable?

      ------ THH: ------
      You may have a point...

      The current logic is to try and take any one set of data from
      either the base object or the debug object. There are four sets
      of data we consider:

         - Symbol Table
         - Stabs
         - DWARF1
         - DWARF2

      If we see the primary section for a given set in the base object
      then we ignore all sections relating to that set in the debug
      object.

      Now in principle if we saw a secondary section (like debug_line
      say) in the base object, but not the main section (debug_info in
      this case) then we would take debug_info from the debug object
      but would use the debug_line from the base object unless we saw
      a replacement copy in the debug object. That's probably unlikely
      however.

      A bigger issue might be, as you say, the symbol table as we will
      pick that up from the debug object if it isn't in the base. The
      dynamic symbol table will always have to be in the base object
      though so we will have to be careful when processing symbols to
      know which table we are reading in that case.

      What we probably need to do is tell read_elf_symtab which object
      the symbols it is being asked to read came from.

      (A followup patch to deal with this was committed in r9469).

      The machine specific information (i.e. the DiCfSI_m struct)
      are stored in cfsi_m_pool, as these are highly duplicated.
      The DiCfSI_m are allocated in cfsi_m_pool and identified using
      a (we hope) small integer : often one byte is enough, sometimes
      2 bytes are needed.

      cfsi_base contains the bases of the code address ranges.
      cfsi_size is the size of the cfsi_base array.
      The elements cfsi_base[0] till cfsi_base[cfsi_used-1] are used.
      Following elements are not used (yet).

      For each base in cfsi_base, an index into cfsi_m_pool is stored
      in cfsi_m_ix array. The size of cfsi_m_ix is equal to
      cfsi_size*sizeof_cfsi_m_ix. The used portion of cfsi_m_ix is
      cfsi_m_ix[0] till cfsi_m_ix[(cfsi_used-1)*sizeof_cfsi_m_ix].

      cfsi_base[i] gives the base address of a code range covered by
      some CF Info. The corresponding CF Info is identified by an index
      in cfsi_m_pool. The DiCfSI_m index in cfsi_m_pool corresponding to
      cfsi_base[i] is given
        by ((UChar*) cfsi_m_ix)[i] if sizeof_cfsi_m_ix == 1
        by ((UShort*)cfsi_m_ix)[i] if sizeof_cfsi_m_ix == 2
        by ((UInt*)  cfsi_m_ix)[i] if sizeof_cfsi_m_ix == 4.

      The end of the code range starting at cfsi_base[i] is given by
      cfsi_base[i+1]-1 (or cfsi_maxavma for  cfsi_base[cfsi_used-1]).
      Some code ranges between cfsi_minavma and cfsi_maxavma might not
      be covered by cfi information. Such not covered ranges are stored by
      a base in cfsi_base and a corresponding 0 index in cfsi_m_ix.

      A variable size representation has been chosen for the elements of
      cfsi_m_ix as in many case, one byte is good enough. For big
      objects, 2 bytes are needed. No object has yet been found where
      4 bytes are needed (but the code is ready to handle this case).
      Not covered ranges ('cfi holes') are stored explicitly in
      cfsi_base/cfsi_m_ix as this is more memory efficient than storing
      a length for each covered range : on x86 or amd64, we typically have
      a hole every 8 covered ranges. On arm64, we have very few holes
      (1 every 50 or 100 ranges).
      
      The cfsi information is read and prepared in the cfsi_rd array.
      Once all the information has been read, the cfsi_base and cfsi_m_ix
      arrays will be filled in from cfsi_rd. cfsi_rd will then be freed.
      This is all done by ML_(finish_CFSI_arrays).

      In short it's an

         array of (array of PC address ranges and variables)

      The outer array indexes over scopes, with Entry 0 containing
      information on variables which exist for any value of the program
      counter (PC) -- that is, the outermost scope.  Entries 1, 2, 3,
      etc contain information on increasinly deeply nested variables.

      Each inner array is an array of (an address range, and a set
      of variables that are in scope over that address range).  

      The address ranges may not overlap.
