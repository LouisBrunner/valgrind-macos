Release 3.26.0 (24 Oct 2025)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,
PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,
MIPS64/Linux, RISCV64/Linux, ARM/Android, ARM64/Android, MIPS32/Android,
X86/Android, X86/Solaris, AMD64/Solaris, AMD64/MacOSX 10.12, X86/FreeBSD,
AMD64/FreeBSD and ARM64/FreeBSD There is also preliminary support for
X86/macOS 10.13, AMD64/macOS 10.13 and nanoMIPS/Linux.

* ==================== CORE CHANGES ===================

* Upgrade to the GNU General Public License version 3.

* Control building documentation. When using make dist set the
  Makefile BUILD_DOCS to none, all or html. none, does not build any
  documentation.  all, builds all documentation. html, builds HTML
  docs but skips building PDFs. See also README_DEVELOPERS.

* New VEX API function LibVEX_set_VexControl

* The deprecated IROps: Iop_Clz32/64 and Iop_Ctz32/64 have been removed

* The Linux Test Project (LTP) integration has been updated to
  v20250930. The test output has been made compatible with bunsen.
  Various issues with the linux syscall wrappers have been fixed.

  New Linux syscall wrappers for: cachestat, futex_waitv, listmount,
  mount_setattr, mseal, quotactl_fd, remap_file_pages, setdomainname,
  statmount, swapoff, swapon, sysfs and ustat.

* --modify-fds=yes has been added. It acts like --modify-fds=high (the
  highest available file descriptor is returned first) except when
  when the lowers stdin/stdout/stderr (file descriptors 0, 1, 2) are
  available. With --modify-fds=yes 0, 1 or 2 are always returned first
  when still available before higher file descriptor numbers are.

* With --xml=yes log output protocol 6 is now always used (unlike
  protocol 5 which was only used with--track-fds). The main difference
  is that the xml output now contains error summaries. See also
  xml-output-protocol6.txt.

* Add "bad" option for --track-fds. When --track-fds=bad is specified,
  do not produce errors about unclosed file descriptors at program
  exit. Only produce errors for bad file descriptor usage, either
  double close or use of file descriptor that is (no longer) valid.

* vgdb will now handle the qExecAndArgs packet.

* DWARF inlined subroutine handling has been rewritten to work cross
  compile units. This should get rid of backtraces with
  "UnknownInlinedFun".

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

FreeBSD 15 (which is expected to ship in December 2025, after
Valgrind 3.26 is released) contains a change to ptrace that affects
use of Valgrind with vgdb. This impacts the mechanism that vgdb
uses to interrupt Valgrind if all threads are blocked and you want
to get back to the gdb prompt by hitting ctrl-c. This mechanism
is no longer reliable. On arm64 Valgrind will crash with an assert.
On amd64 syscalls may give spurious and incorrect return codes.

There is a workaround. Run the following command (as root).

 sysctl debug.ptrace_attach_transparent=0

 See also
 https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=290008

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ===================

* There is a new utility script, "vgstack". It has two
  option, -h for minimal help, and -v for the version information.
  In normal use pass it the PID of a running Valgrind process
  and it will perform a vgdb attach and print the backtrace(s)
  of the guest executable.

* Memcheck handling of aligned allocation functions with a
  size of zero has changed.

  Firstly, 'free_aligned_sized' with a size of
  zero is no longer considered an error. This was intended so
  that deallocation had the same behaviour as allocation. In
  practice, platforms that allow aligned allocation with a
  size of zero will already generate an error at allocation.
  Other platforms will get an 'Invalid free' error. The case
  where the allocation and deallocation sizes are different
  with the deallocation size being zero is already covered by
  "Mismatched [alloc/dealloc] size" errors.

  Secondly, the three C aligned allocation functions memalign,
  aligned_alloc and posix_memalign have a different error
  message if used with a size of zero. Previously the error
  was "[function] invalid size value: [number]". This was an
  overstatement of the issue. The problem is that such usage
  is not portable across platforms. memalign and aligned_alloc
  are poorly documented, saying things like "Behavior is undefined
  if size is not an integral multiple of alignment.". Clearly
  this does not include negative integers though it does not say
  so explicitly. Does that include zero?  posix_memalign is well documented
  but says that using a size of 0 is implementation-defined. These
  functions now produce an error
  "Unsafe allocation with size of zero is implementation-defined".

  The associated suppression name has also changed from "BadSize" to
  "UnsafeZeroSize".

  Checks for C23 free_sized and free_aligned_sized have been added to
  Linux. Almost no libraries support these functions yet, with
  the exception being Google tcmalloc.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that
are not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.25.0 (25 Apr 2025)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,
PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,
MIPS64/Linux, RISCV64/Linux, ARM/Android, ARM64/Android, MIPS32/Android,
X86/Android, X86/Solaris, AMD64/Solaris, AMD64/MacOSX 10.12, X86/FreeBSD,
AMD64/FreeBSD and ARM64/FreeBSD There is also preliminary support for
X86/macOS 10.13, AMD64/macOS 10.13 and nanoMIPS/Linux.

* ==================== CORE CHANGES ===================

* The valgrind gdbserver now supports the GDB remote protocol packet
  'x addr,len' (available in GDB release >= 16).
  The x packet can reduce the time taken by GDB to read memory from valgrind.

* Valgrind now supports zstd compressed debug sections.

* The Linux Test Project (ltp) is integrated in the testsuite try
  'make ltpchecks' (this will take a while and will point out various
  missing syscalls and valgrind crashes!)

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Added RISCV64 support for Linux. Specifically for the RV64GC
  instruction set.

* Numerous bug fixes for Illumos, in particular fixed a Valgrind crash
  whenever a signal handler was called.

* On FreeBSD, a change to the libc code that runs atexit handlers was
  causing Helgrind to produce an extra error about exiting threads
  still holding locks for. This applied to every multithreaded application.
  The extra error is now filtered out. A syscall wrapper had been added
  for getrlimitusage.

* On Linux various new syscalls are supported (landlock*, io_pgetevents,
  open_tree, move_mount, fsopen, fsconfig, fsmount, fspick, userfaultfd).

* s390x has support for various new instructions (BPP, BPRP, PPA and NIAI).

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ===================

* The --track-fds=yes and --track-fds=all options now treat all
  inherited file descriptors the same as 0, 1, 2 (stdin/out/err).
  And when the stdin/out/err descriptors are reassigned they are
  now treated as normal (non-inherited) file descriptors.

* A new option --modify-fds=high can be used together with
  --track-fds=yes to create new file descriptors with the highest
  possible number (and then decreasing) instead of always using the
  lowest possible number (which is required by POSIX). This will help
  catch issues where a file descriptor number might normally be reused
  between a close and another open call.

* Helgrind:
  There is a change to warnings about calls to pthread_cond_signal and
  pthread_cond_broadcast when the associated mutex is unlocked. Previously
  Helgrind would always warn about this. Now this error is controlled by
  a command line option, --check-cond-signal-mutex=yes|no. The default is
  no. This change has been made because some C and C++ standard libraries
  use pthread_cond_signal/pthread_cond_broadcast in this way. Users are
  obliged to use suppressions if they wish to avoid this noise.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that

Release 3.23.0 (26 Apr 2024)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,
PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,
MIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android, ARM64/Android, MIPS32/Android, X86/Android,
X86/Solaris, AMD64/Solaris, AMD64/MacOSX 10.12, X86/FreeBSD, AMD64/FreeBSD
and ARM64/FreeBSD  There is also preliminary support for X86/macOS 10.13,
AMD64/macOS 10.13 and nanoMIPS/Linux.

* ==================== CORE CHANGES ===================

* --track-fds=yes will now also warn about double closing of file
  descriptors. Printing the context where the file descriptor was
  originally opened and where it was previously closed.

* --track-fds=yes also produces "real" errors now which can be
  suppressed and work with --error-exitcode. When combined with
  --xml the xml-output now also includes FdBadClose and FdNotClosed
  error kinds (see docs/internals/xml-output-protocol5.txt).

* The option --show-error-list=no|yes now accepts a new value all.
  This indicates to also print the suppressed errors.
  This is useful to analyse which errors are suppressed by which
  suppression entries.
  The valgrind monitor command 'v.info all_errors' similarly now
  accepts a new optional argument 'also_suppressed' to show
  all errors including the suppressed errors.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Added ARM64 support for FreeBSD.

* ARM64 now supports dotprod instructions (sdot/udot).

* AMD64 better supports code build with -march=x86-64-v3.
  fused-multiple-add instructions (fma) are now emulated more
  accurately. And memcheck now handles __builtin_strcmp using 128/256
  bit vectors with sse4.1, avx/avx2.

* S390X added support for NNPA (neural network processing assist)
  facility vector instructions VCNF, VCLFNH, VCFN, VCLFNL, VCRNF and
  NNPA (z16/arch14).

* X86 recognizes new binutils-2.42 nop patterns.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ===================

* The none tool now also supports xml output.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that
are not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

(3.23.0.RC2: 24 Apr 2024)

Release 3.22.0 (31 Oct 2023)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,
PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,
MIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android, ARM64/Android, MIPS32/Android, X86/Android,
X86/Solaris, AMD64/Solaris, AMD64/MacOSX 10.12, X86/FreeBSD and
AMD64/FreeBSD.  There is also preliminary support for X86/macOS 10.13,
AMD64/macOS 10.13 and nanoMIPS/Linux.

* ==================== CORE CHANGES ===================

* A new configure option --with-gdbscripts-dir lets you install
  the gdb valgrind python monitor scripts in a specific location.
  For example a distro could use it to install the scripts in a
  safe load location --with-gdbscripts-dir=%{_datadir}/gdb/auto-load
  It is also possible to configure --without-gdb-scripts-dir so no
  .debug_gdb_scripts section is added to the vgpreload library and
  no valgrind-monitor python scripts are installed at all.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Support has been added for FreeBSD 14 and FreeBSD 15.
* Add support for the folllowing FreeBSD system calls:
  close_range, kqueuex, membarrier, timerfd_create,
  timerfd_settime and timerfd_gettime (all added in FreeBSD 15).

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ===================

* Memcheck now tests and warns about the values used for
  alignment and size. These apply to various functions: memalign,
  posix_memalign and aligned_alloc in C and various overloads
  of operators new and delete in C++. The kinds of error that can
  be detected are
  - invalid alignment, for instance the alignment is usually required
    to be a power of 2
  - mismatched alignment between aligned allocation and aligned
    deallocation
  - mismatched size when sized delete is used
  - bad size for functions that have implementation defined behaviour
    when the requested size is zero

* Cachegrind:
  - You can now profile part of a program's execution using the new
    `CACHEGRIND_START_INSTRUMENTATION` and `CACHEGRIND_STOP_INSTRUMENTATION`
    client requests, along with the new `--instr-at-start` option. The
    behaviour is the same as Callgrind's equivalent functionality.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that
are not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

(3.22.0.RC2: 26 Oct 2023)

Release 3.21.0 (28 Apr 2023)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,
PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,

AMD64/macOS 10.13 and nanoMIPS/Linux.

* ==================== CORE CHANGES ===================

* When GDB is used to debug a program running under valgrind using
  the valgrind gdbserver, GDB will automatically load some
  python code provided in valgrind defining GDB front end commands
  corresponding to the valgrind monitor commands.
  These GDB front end commands accept the same format as
  the monitor commands directly sent to the Valgrind gdbserver.
  These GDB front end commands provide a better integration
  in the GDB command line interface, so as to use for example
  GDB auto-completion, command specific help, searching for
  a command or command help matching a regexp, ...
  For relevant monitor commands, GDB will evaluate arguments
  to make the use of monitor commands easier.
  For example, instead of having to print the address of a variable
  to pass it to a subsequent monitor command, the GDB front end
  command will evaluate the address argument. It is for example
  possible to do:
    (gdb) memcheck who_points_at &some_struct sizeof(some_struct)
  instead of:
    (gdb) p &some_struct
    $2 = (some_struct_type *) 0x1130a0 <some_struct>
    (gdb) p sizeof(some_struct)
    $3 = 40
    (gdb) monitor who_point_at 0x1130a0 40

* The vgdb utility now supports extended-remote protocol when
  invoked with --multi. In this mode the GDB run command is
  supported. Which means you don't need to run gdb and valgrind
  from different terminals. So for example to start your program
  in gdb and run it under valgrind you can do:
  $ gdb prog
  (gdb) set remote exec-file prog
  (gdb) set sysroot /
  (gdb) target extended-remote | vgdb --multi
  (gdb) start

* The behaviour of realloc with a size of zero can now
  be changed for tools that intercept malloc. Those
  tools are memcheck, helgrind, drd, massif and dhat.
  Realloc implementations generally do one of two things
     - free the memory like free() and return NULL
       (GNU libc and ptmalloc).
     - either free the memory and then allocate a
       minimum sized block or just return the
       original pointer. Return NULL if the
       allocation of the minimum sized block fails
       (jemalloc, musl, snmalloc, Solaris, macOS).
  When Valgrind is configured and built it will
  try to match the OS and libc behaviour. However
  if you are using a non-default library to replace
  malloc and family (e.g., musl on a glibc Linux or
  tcmalloc on FreeBSD) then you can use a command line
  option to change the behaviour of Valgrind:
    --realloc-zero-bytes-frees=yes|no [yes on Linux glibc, no otherwise]

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Make the address space limit on FreeBSD amd64 128Gbytes
  (the same as Linux and Solaris, it was 32Gbytes)

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ===================

* Memcheck:
  - When doing a delta leak_search, it is now possible to only
    output the new loss records compared to the previous leak search.
    This is available in the memcheck monitor command 'leak_search'
    by specifying the "new" keyword or in your program by using
    the client request VALGRIND_DO_NEW_LEAK_CHECK.
    Whenever a "delta" leak search is done (i.e. when specifying
    "new" or "increased" or "changed" in the monitor command),
    the new loss records have a "new" marker.
  - Valgrind now contains python code that defines GDB memcheck
    front end monitor commands. See CORE CHANGES.
  - Performs checks for the use of realloc with a size of zero.
    This is non-portable and a source of errors. If memcheck
    detects such a usage it will generate an error
      realloc() with size 0
    followed by the usual callstacks.
    A switch has been added to allow this to be turned off:
      --show-realloc-size-zero=yes|no [yes]

* Helgrind:
  - The option ---history-backtrace-size=<number> allows to configure
    the number of entries to record in the stack traces of "old"
    accesses. Previously, this number was hardcoded to 8.
  - Valgrind now contains python code that defines GDB helgrind
    front end monitor commands. See CORE CHANGES.

* Cachegrind:
  - `--cache-sim=no` is now the default. The cache simulation is old and
    unlikely to match any real modern machine. This means only the `Ir`
    event are gathered by default, but that is by far the most useful
    event.
  - `cg_annotate`, `cg_diff`, and `cg_merge` have been rewritten in
    Python. As a result, they all have more flexible command line
    argument handling, e.g. supporting `--show-percs` and
    `--no-show-percs` forms as well as the existing `--show-percs=yes`
    and `--show-percs=no`.
  - `cg_annotate` has some functional changes.
    - It's much faster, e.g. 3-4x on common cases.
    - It now supports diffing (with `--diff`, `--mod-filename`, and
      `--mod-funcname`) and merging (by passing multiple data files).
    - It now provides more information at the file and function level.
      There are now "File:function" and "Function:file" sections. These
      are very useful for programs that use inlining a lot.
    - Support for user-annotated files and the `-I`/`--include` option
      has been removed, because it was of little use and blocked other
      improvements.
    - The `--auto` option is renamed `--annotate`, though the old
      `--auto=yes`/`--auto=no` forms are still supported.
  - `cg_diff` and `cg_merge` are now deprecated, because `cg_annotate`
    now does a better job of diffing and merging.
  - The Cachegrind output file format has changed very slightly, but in
    ways nobody is likely to notice.

* Callgrind:
  - Valgrind now contains python code that defines GDB callgrind
    front end monitor commands. See CORE CHANGES.

* Massif:
  - Valgrind now contains python code that defines GDB massif
    front end monitor commands. See CORE CHANGES.

* DHAT:
  - A new kind of user request has been added which allows you to
    override the 1024 byte limit on access count histograms for blocks
    of memory. The client request is DHAT_HISTOGRAM_MEMORY.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that

Release 3.20.0 (24 Oct 2022)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,
PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,
MIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android, ARM64/Android, MIPS32/Android, X86/Android,
X86/Solaris, AMD64/Solaris, AMD64/MacOSX 10.12, X86/FreeBSD and
AMD64/FreeBSD.  There is also preliminary support for X86/macOS 10.13,
AMD64/macOS 10.13 and nanoMIPS/Linux.

* ==================== CORE CHANGES ===================

* The option "--vgdb-stop-at=event1,event2,..." accepts the new value abexit.
  This indicates to invoke gdbserver when your program exits abnormally
  (i.e. with a non zero exit code).
* Fix Rust v0 name demangling.
* The Linux rseq syscall is now implemented as (silently) returning ENOSYS.
* Add FreeBSD syscall wrappers for __specialfd and __realpathat.
* Remove FreeBSD dependencies on COMPAT10, which fixes compatibility with
  HardenedBSD
* The option --enable-debuginfod=<no|yes> [default: yes] has been added on
  Linux.
* More DWARF5 support as generated by clang14.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that
are not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

* Add FreeBSD syscall wrappers for __specialfd and __realpathat.
* Remove FreeBSD dependencies on COMPAT10, which fixes compatibility with HardenedBSD

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* arm64:
  - ignore the "v8.x" architecture levels, only look at actual CPU features
    present. Fixes mismatch detected between RDMA and atomics features
    preventing startup on some QEMU configurations.
  - Implement LD{,A}XP and ST{,L}XP
  - Fix incorrect code emitted for doubleword CAS.

* s390:
  - Fix sys_ipc semtimedop syscall
  - Fix VFLRX and WFLRX instructions
  - Fix EXRL instruction with negative offset

* ppc64:
  - Reimplement the vbpermq instruction support to generate less Iops and
    avoid overflowing internal buffers.
  - Fix checking for scv support to avoid "Facility 'SCV' unavailable (12),
    exception" messages in dmsg.
  - Fix setting condition code for Vector Compare quad word instructions.
  - Fix fix lxsibzx, lxsihzx and lxsihzx instructions so they only load
    their respective sized data.
  - Fix the prefixed stq instruction in PC relative mode.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ===================

* Memcheck:
  - Speed up --track-origins=yes for large (in the range of hundreds to
    thousands of megabytes) mmap/munmaps.
* DRD/Helgrind:
  - Several fixes for new versions of libstd++ using new posix try_lock
    functions
