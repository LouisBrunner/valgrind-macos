      is, collect a stack trace for a thread every time its vector
      clock changes.  This facilitates showing the bounds of the
      conflicting segment(s), with relatively small overhead.

   2: "full": collect a stack trace every time the constraints for a
      location change.  This facilitates showing both stack traces in
      a race, although can be very expensive in time and space
      (depends on the rate that threads "drag" locations across
      vector-clock-change boundaries ("dragovers").  This involves
