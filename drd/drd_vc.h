/*
 * DRD vector clock implementation:
 * - One counter per thread.
 * - A vector clock is implemented as multiple pairs of (thread id, counter).
 * - Pairs are stored in an array sorted by thread id.
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - Each time a thread performs an action that implies an ordering between
 *   intra-thread events, the counter of that thread is incremented.
 * - Vector clocks are compared by comparing all counters of all threads.
 * - When a thread synchronization action is performed that guarantees that
 *   new actions of the current thread are executed after the actions of the
 *   other thread, the vector clock of the synchronization object and the
 *   current thread are combined (by taking the component-wise maximum).
 * - A vector clock is incremented during actions such as
 *   pthread_create(), pthread_mutex_unlock(), sem_post(). (Actions where
 *   an inter-thread ordering "arrow" starts).
