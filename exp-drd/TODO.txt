Data-race detection algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Implement segment merging, such that the number of segments per thread
  remains limited even when there is no synchronization between threads.
- Find out why a race is reported on std::string::string(std::string const&)
  (stc test case 16).
- Make sure that drd supports more than 256 mutexes.
- Performance testing and tuning.
- pthread rwlock state tracking and support.
- pthread barrier state tracking and support.
- mutexes: support for pthread_mutex_timedlock() (recently added to the POSIX
  spec, and present in glibc). See also
  http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_mutex_timedlock.html
- testing on PPC and AIX (current implementation is only tested on X86 and
  AMD64).
- Change s_threadinfo[] from an array into an OSet or VgHashTable, in order to
  make ThreadId <> DrdThreadId <> pthread_t conversions faster.
- [AMD64] Find out why removing 'write(1, "", 0)' in drd_preloaded.c triggers
  a crash on AMD64. Is this a drd or a VEX bug ?
- Reintroduce the const keyword in the function declarations of the OSet
  implementation in the core where appropriate.

Testing
~~~~~~~
- testing with more complex multithreaded test programs.
- test drd's performance with the SPLASH-2 software, e.g. fft
  (http://www-flash.stanford.edu/apps/SPLASH/).
- Add helgrind's unit tests to drd's unit test set by adding soft links
  under drd/tests to the respective helgrind unit tests.


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Document the code.
- Document how to use the tool.


Known bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
- Gets killed by the OOM handler for some applications, e.g. knode and
  OpenOffice.
- [AMD64] Reports "Allocation context: unknown" for BSS symbols on AMD64
  (works fine on X86). This is a bug in Valgrind's debug info reader
  -- VG_(find_seginfo)() returns NULL for BSS symbols on AMD64. Not yet in
  the KDE bug tracking system.
- False positives are reported when a signal is sent via pthread_kill() from
  one thread to another (bug 152728).
- Crashes (cause not known): VALGRIND_LIB=$PWD/.in_place coregrind/valgrind --tool=exp-drd --trace-mem=yes /bin/ls

Known performance issues:
- According to cachegrind, VG_(OSet_Next)() is taking up most CPU cycles.
  Probably due to the bitmap implementation.
