<h2>5&nbsp; <b>Addrcheck</b>: a lightweight memory checker</h2>

To use this tool, you must specify <code>--tool=addrcheck</code>
on the Valgrind command line.

<h3>5.1&nbsp; Kinds of bugs that Addrcheck can find</h3>

Addrcheck is a simplified version of the Memcheck tool described
in Section 3.  It is identical in every way to Memcheck, except for
one important detail: it does not do the undefined-value checks that
Memcheck does.  This means Addrcheck is about twice as fast as
Memcheck, and uses less memory.  Addrcheck can detect the following
errors:
    <ul>
        <li>Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd</li>
        <li>Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks</li>
        <li>Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack</li>
        <li>Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost
            forever</li>
        <li>Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []</li>
        <li>Some misuses of the POSIX pthreads API</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

<p>
Rather than duplicate much of the Memcheck docs here (a.k.a. since I
am a lazy b'stard), users of Addrcheck are advised to read
the section on Memcheck.  Some important points:
<ul>
<li>Addrcheck is exactly like Memcheck, except that all the
   value-definedness tracking machinery has been removed.  Therefore,
   the Memcheck documentation which discusses definedess ("V-bits") is
   irrelevant.  The stuff on addressibility ("A-bits") is still
   relevant.
<p>
<li>Addrcheck accepts the same command-line flags as Memcheck, with
    the exception of ... (to be filled in).
<p>
<li>Like Memcheck, Addrcheck will do memory leak checking (internally,
    the same code does leak checking for both tools).  The only
    difference is how the two tools decide which memory locations
    to consider when searching for pointers to blocks.  Memcheck will
    only consider 4-byte aligned locations which are validly
    addressible and which hold defined values.  Addrcheck does not
    track definedness and so cannot apply the last, "defined value",
    criteria.  
    <p>
    The result is that Addrcheck's leak checker may "discover"
    pointers to blocks that Memcheck would not.  So it is possible
    that Memcheck could (correctly) conclude that a block is leaked,
    yet Addrcheck would not conclude that.
    <p>
    Whether or not this has any effect in practice is unknown.  I
    suspect not, but that is mere speculation at this stage.
</ul>

<p>
Addrcheck is, therefore, a fine-grained address checker.  All it
really does is check each memory reference to say whether or not that
location may validly be addressed.  Addrcheck has a memory overhead of
one bit per byte of used address space.  In contrast, Memcheck has an
overhead of nine bits per byte.

<p>
Due to lazyness on the part of the implementor (Julian), error
messages from Addrcheck do not distinguish reads from writes.  So it
will say, for example, "Invalid memory access of size 4", whereas 
Memcheck would have said whether the access is a read or a write.
This could easily be remedied, if anyone is particularly bothered.

<p>
Addrcheck is quite pleasant to use.  It's faster than Memcheck, and
the lack of valid-value checks has another side effect: the errors it
does report are relatively easy to track down, compared to the 
tedious and often confusing search sometimes needed to find the 
cause of uninitialised-value errors reported by Memcheck.  

<p>
Because it is faster and lighter than Memcheck, our hope is that
Addrcheck is more suitable for less-intrusive, larger scale testing
than is viable with Memcheck.  As of mid-November 2002, we have
experimented with running the KDE-3.1 desktop on Addrcheck (the entire
process tree, starting from <code>startkde</code>).  Running on a
512MB, 1.7 GHz P4, the result is nearly usable.  The ultimate aim is
that is fast and unintrusive enough that (eg) KDE sessions may be
unintrusively monitored for addressing errors whilst people do real
work with their KDE desktop.

<p>
Addrcheck is a new experiment in the Valgrind world.  We'd be
interested to hear your feedback on it.
