<title>Using and understanding the Valgrind core</title>

<para>This section describes the Valgrind core services, flags
and behaviours.  That means it is relevant regardless of what
particular tool you are using.  A point of terminology: most
references to "valgrind" in the rest of this section (Section 2)
refer to the valgrind core services.</para>

<sect1 id="manual-core.whatdoes" 
       xreflabel="What Valgrind does with your program">
<title>What Valgrind does with your program</title>

<para>Valgrind is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. It
works directly with existing executables. You don't need to
recompile, relink, or otherwise modify, the program to be
checked.</para>

<para>Simply put <computeroutput>valgrind
--tool=tool_name</computeroutput> at the start of the command
line normally used to run the program.  For example, if want to
run the command <computeroutput>ls -l</computeroutput> using the
heavyweight memory-checking tool Memcheck, issue the
command:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
valgrind --tool=memcheck ls -l]]></programlisting>

<para>Regardless of which tool is in use, Valgrind takes control
of your program before it starts.  Debugging information is read
from the executable and associated libraries, so that error
messages and other outputs can be phrased in terms of source code
locations (if that is appropriate).</para>

<para>Your program is then run on a synthetic x86 CPU provided by
the Valgrind core.  As new code is executed for the first time,
the core hands the code to the selected tool.  The tool adds its
own instrumentation code to this and hands the result back to the
core, which coordinates the continued execution of this
instrumented code.</para>

<para>The amount of instrumentation code added varies widely
between tools.  At one end of the scale, Memcheck adds code to
check every memory access and every value computed, increasing
the size of the code at least 12 times, and making it run 25-50
times slower than natively.  At the other end of the spectrum,
the ultra-trivial "none" tool (a.k.a. Nulgrind) adds no
instrumentation at all and causes in total "only" about a 4 times
slowdown.</para>

<para>Valgrind simulates every single instruction your program
executes.  Because of this, the active tool checks, or profiles,
not only the code in your application but also in all supporting
dynamically-linked (<computeroutput>.so</computeroutput>-format)
libraries, including the GNU C library, the X client libraries,
Qt, if you work with KDE, and so on.</para>

<para>If you're using one of the error-detection tools, Valgrind
will often detect errors in libraries, for example the GNU C or
X11 libraries, which you have to use.  You might not be
interested in these errors, since you probably have no control
over that code.  Therefore, Valgrind allows you to selectively
suppress errors, by recording them in a suppressions file which
is read when Valgrind starts up.  The build mechanism attempts to
select suppressions which give reasonable behaviour for the libc
and XFree86 versions detected on your machine.  To make it easier
to write suppressions, you can use the
<computeroutput>--gen-suppressions=yes</computeroutput> option
which tells Valgrind to print out a suppression for each error
that appears, which you can then copy into a suppressions
file.</para>

<para>Different error-checking tools report different kinds of
errors.  The suppression mechanism therefore allows you to say
which tool or tool(s) each suppression applies to.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="manual-core.started" xreflabel="Getting started">
<title>Getting started</title>

<para>First off, consider whether it might be beneficial to
recompile your application and supporting libraries with
debugging info enabled (the <computeroutput>-g</computeroutput>
flag).  Without debugging info, the best Valgrind tools will be
able to do is guess which function a particular piece of code
belongs to, which makes both error messages and profiling output
nearly useless.  With <computeroutput>-g</computeroutput>, you'll
hopefully get messages which point directly to the relevant
source code lines.</para>

<para>Another flag you might like to consider, if you are working
with C++, is <computeroutput>-fno-inline</computeroutput>.  That
makes it easier to see the function-call chain, which can help
reduce confusion when navigating around large C++ apps.  For
whatever it's worth, debugging OpenOffice.org with Memcheck is a
bit easier when using this flag.</para>

<para>You don't have to do this, but doing so helps Valgrind
produce more accurate and less confusing error reports.  Chances
are you're set up like this already, if you intended to debug
your program with GNU gdb, or some other debugger.</para>

<para>This paragraph applies only if you plan to use Memcheck: On
rare occasions, optimisation levels at
<computeroutput>-O2</computeroutput> and above have been observed
to generate code which fools Memcheck into wrongly reporting
uninitialised value errors.  We have looked in detail into fixing
this, and unfortunately the result is that doing so would give a
further significant slowdown in what is already a slow tool.  So
the best solution is to turn off optimisation altogether.  Since
this often makes things unmanagably slow, a plausible compromise
is to use <computeroutput>-O</computeroutput>.  This gets you the
majority of the benefits of higher optimisation levels whilst
keeping relatively small the chances of false complaints from
Memcheck.  All other tools (as far as we know) are unaffected by
optimisation level.</para>

<para>Valgrind understands both the older "stabs" debugging
format, used by gcc versions prior to 3.1, and the newer DWARF2
format used by gcc 3.1 and later.  We continue to refine and
debug our debug-info readers, although the majority of effort
will naturally enough go into the newer DWARF2 reader.</para>

<para>When you're ready to roll, just run your application as you
would normally, but place <computeroutput>valgrind
--tool=tool_name</computeroutput> in front of your usual
command-line invocation.  Note that you should run the real
(machine-code) executable here.  If your application is started
by, for example, a shell or perl script, you'll need to modify it
to invoke Valgrind on the real executables.  Running such scripts
directly under Valgrind will result in you getting error reports
pertaining to <computeroutput>/bin/sh</computeroutput>,
<computeroutput>/usr/bin/perl</computeroutput>, or whatever
interpreter you're using.  This may not be what you want and can
be confusing.  You can force the issue by giving the flag
<computeroutput>--trace-children=yes</computeroutput>, but
confusion is still likely.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="manual-core.comment" xreflabel="The commentary">
<title>The commentary</title>

<para>Valgrind tools write a commentary, a stream of text,
detailing error reports and other significant events.  All lines
in the commentary have following form:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
==12345== some-message-from-Valgrind]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>The <computeroutput>12345</computeroutput> is the process
ID.  This scheme makes it easy to distinguish program output from
Valgrind commentary, and also easy to differentiate commentaries
from different processes which have become merged together, for
whatever reason.</para>

<para>By default, Valgrind tools write only essential messages to
the commentary, so as to avoid flooding you with information of
secondary importance.  If you want more information about what is
happening, re-run, passing the
<computeroutput>-v</computeroutput> flag to Valgrind.</para>

<para>You can direct the commentary to three different
places:</para>

<orderedlist>

 <listitem id="manual-core.out2fd" xreflabel="Directing output to fd">
   <para>The default: send it to a file descriptor, which is by
   default 2 (stderr).  So, if you give the core no options, it
   will write commentary to the standard error stream.  If you
   want to send it to some other file descriptor, for example
   number 9, you can specify
   <computeroutput>--log-fd=9</computeroutput>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem id="manual-core.out2file" 
            xreflabel="Directing output to file">
   <para>A less intrusive option is to write the commentary to a
   file, which you specify by
   <computeroutput>--log-file=filename</computeroutput>.  Note
   carefully that the commentary is <command>not</command>
   written to the file you specify, but instead to one called
   <computeroutput>filename.pid12345</computeroutput>, if for
   example the pid of the traced process is 12345.  This is
   helpful when valgrinding a whole tree of processes at once,
   since it means that each process writes to its own logfile,
   rather than the result being jumbled up in one big
   logfile.</para>

   <para>If you want to specify precisely the file name to use,
   without the trailing
   <computeroutput>.pid12345</computeroutput>part, you can instead use
   <computeroutput>--log-file-exactly=filename</computeroutput>.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem id="manual-core.out2socket" 
            xreflabel="Directing output to network socket">
   <para>The least intrusive option is to send the commentary to
   a network socket.  The socket is specified as an IP address
   and port number pair, like this:
   <computeroutput>--log-socket=192.168.0.1:12345</computeroutput>
   if you want to send the output to host IP 192.168.0.1 port
   12345 (I have no idea if 12345 is a port of pre-existing
   significance).  You can also omit the port number:
   <computeroutput>--log-socket=192.168.0.1</computeroutput>, in
   which case a default port of 1500 is used.  This default is
   defined by the constant
   <computeroutput>VG_CLO_DEFAULT_LOGPORT</computeroutput> in the
   sources.</para>

   <para>Note, unfortunately, that you have to use an IP address
   here, rather than a hostname.</para>

   <para>Writing to a network socket is pretty useless if you
   don't have something listening at the other end.  We provide a
   simple listener program,
   <computeroutput>valgrind-listener</computeroutput>, which
   accepts connections on the specified port and copies whatever
   it is sent to stdout.  Probably someone will tell us this is a
   horrible security risk.  It seems likely that people will
   write more sophisticated listeners in the fullness of
   time.</para>

   <para>valgrind-listener can accept simultaneous connections
   from up to 50 valgrinded processes.  In front of each line of
   output it prints the current number of active connections in
   round brackets.</para>

   <para>valgrind-listener accepts two command-line flags:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para><computeroutput>-e</computeroutput> or 
      <computeroutput>--exit-at-zero</computeroutput>: when the
      number of connected processes falls back to zero, exit.
      Without this, it will run forever, that is, until you send
      it Control-C.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para><computeroutput>portnumber</computeroutput>: changes
      the port it listens on from the default (1500).  The
      specified port must be in the range 1024 to 65535.  The
      same restriction applies to port numbers specified by a
      <computeroutput>--log-socket=</computeroutput> to Valgrind
      itself.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If a valgrinded process fails to connect to a listener,
    for whatever reason (the listener isn't running, invalid or
    unreachable host or port, etc), Valgrind switches back to
    writing the commentary to stderr.  The same goes for any
    process which loses an established connection to a listener.
    In other words, killing the listener doesn't kill the
    processes sending data to it.</para>
  </listitem>
 </orderedlist>

<para>Here is an important point about the relationship between
the commentary and profiling output from tools.  The commentary
contains a mix of messages from the Valgrind core and the
selected tool.  If the tool reports errors, it will report them
to the commentary.  However, if the tool does profiling, the
profile data will be written to a file of some kind, depending on
the tool, and independent of what
<computeroutput>--log-*</computeroutput> options are in force.
The commentary is intended to be a low-bandwidth, human-readable
channel.  Profiling data, on the other hand, is usually
voluminous and not meaningful without further processing, which
is why we have chosen this arrangement.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="manual-core.report" xreflabel="Reporting of errors">
<title>Reporting of errors</title>

<para>When one of the error-checking tools (Memcheck, Addrcheck,
Helgrind) detects something bad happening in the program, an
error message is written to the commentary.  For example:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
==25832== Invalid read of size 4
==25832==    at 0x8048724: BandMatrix::ReSize(int, int, int) (bogon.cpp:45)
==25832==    by 0x80487AF: main (bogon.cpp:66)
==25832==    by 0x40371E5E: __libc_start_main (libc-start.c:129)
==25832==    by 0x80485D1: (within /home/sewardj/newmat10/bogon)
==25832==    Address 0xBFFFF74C is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd]]></programlisting>

<para>This message says that the program did an illegal 4-byte
read of address 0xBFFFF74C, which, as far as Memcheck can tell,
is not a valid stack address, nor corresponds to any currently
malloc'd or free'd blocks.  The read is happening at line 45 of
<filename>bogon.cpp</filename>, called from line 66 of the same
file, etc.  For errors associated with an identified
malloc'd/free'd block, for example reading free'd memory,
Valgrind reports not only the location where the error happened,
but also where the associated block was malloc'd/free'd.</para>

<para>Valgrind remembers all error reports.  When an error is
detected, it is compared against old reports, to see if it is a
duplicate.  If so, the error is noted, but no further commentary
is emitted.  This avoids you being swamped with bazillions of
duplicate error reports.</para>

<para>If you want to know how many times each error occurred, run
with the <computeroutput>-v</computeroutput> option.  When
execution finishes, all the reports are printed out, along with,
and sorted by, their occurrence counts.  This makes it easy to
see which errors have occurred most frequently.</para>

<para>Errors are reported before the associated operation
actually happens.  If you're using a tool (Memcheck, Addrcheck)
which does address checking, and your program attempts to read
from address zero, the tool will emit a message to this effect,
and the program will then duly die with a segmentation
fault.</para>

<para>In general, you should try and fix errors in the order that
they are reported.  Not doing so can be confusing.  For example,
a program which copies uninitialised values to several memory
locations, and later uses them, will generate several error
messages, when run on Memcheck.  The first such error message may
well give the most direct clue to the root cause of the
problem.</para>

<para>The process of detecting duplicate errors is quite an
expensive one and can become a significant performance overhead
if your program generates huge quantities of errors.  To avoid
serious problems here, Valgrind will simply stop collecting
errors after 300 different errors have been seen, or 30000 errors
in total have been seen.  In this situation you might as well
stop your program and fix it, because Valgrind won't tell you
anything else useful after this.  Note that the 300/30000 limits
apply after suppressed errors are removed.  These limits are
defined in <filename>core.h</filename> and can be increased
if necessary.</para>

<para>To avoid this cutoff you can use the
<computeroutput>--error-limit=no</computeroutput> flag.  Then
Valgrind will always show errors, regardless of how many there
are.  Use this flag carefully, since it may have a dire effect on
performance.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="manual-core.suppress" xreflabel="Suppressing errors">
<title>Suppressing errors</title>

<para>The error-checking tools detect numerous problems in the
base libraries, such as the GNU C library, and the XFree86 client
libraries, which come pre-installed on your GNU/Linux system.
You can't easily fix these, but you don't want to see these
errors (and yes, there are many!)  So Valgrind reads a list of
errors to suppress at startup.  A default suppression file is
cooked up by the <computeroutput>./configure</computeroutput>
script when the system is built.</para>

<para>You can modify and add to the suppressions file at your
leisure, or, better, write your own.  Multiple suppression files
are allowed.  This is useful if part of your project contains
errors you can't or don't want to fix, yet you don't want to
continuously be reminded of them.</para>

<formalpara><title>Note:</title>
<para>By far the easiest way to add suppressions is to use the
<computeroutput>--gen-suppressions=yes</computeroutput> flag
described in <xref linkend="manual-core.flags"/>.</para>
</formalpara>

<para>Each error to be suppressed is described very specifically,
to minimise the possibility that a suppression-directive
inadvertantly suppresses a bunch of similar errors which you did
want to see.  The suppression mechanism is designed to allow
precise yet flexible specification of errors to suppress.</para>

<para>If you use the <computeroutput>-v</computeroutput> flag, at
the end of execution, Valgrind prints out one line for each used
suppression, giving its name and the number of times it got used.
Here's the suppressions used by a run of <computeroutput>valgrind
--tool=memcheck ls -l</computeroutput>:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
--27579-- supp: 1 socketcall.connect(serv_addr)/__libc_connect/__nscd_getgrgid_r
--27579-- supp: 1 socketcall.connect(serv_addr)/__libc_connect/__nscd_getpwuid_r
--27579-- supp: 6 strrchr/_dl_map_object_from_fd/_dl_map_object]]></programlisting>

<para>Multiple suppressions files are allowed.  By default,
Valgrind uses
<computeroutput>$PREFIX/lib/valgrind/default.supp</computeroutput>.
You can ask to add suppressions from another file, by specifying
<computeroutput>--suppressions=/path/to/file.supp</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>If you want to understand more about suppressions, look at
an existing suppressions file whilst reading the following
documentation.  The file
<computeroutput>glibc-2.2.supp</computeroutput>, in the source
distribution, provides some good examples.</para>

<para>Each suppression has the following components:</para>

 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>First line: its name.  This merely gives a handy name to
   the suppression, by which it is referred to in the summary of
   used suppressions printed out when a program finishes.  It's
   not important what the name is; any identifying string will
   do.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Second line: name of the tool(s) that the suppression is
   for (if more than one, comma-separated), and the name of the
   suppression itself, separated by a colon (Nb: no spaces are
   allowed), eg:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
tool_name1,tool_name2:suppression_name]]></programlisting>

   <para>Recall that Valgrind-2.0.X is a modular system, in which
   different instrumentation tools can observe your program
   whilst it is running.  Since different tools detect different
   kinds of errors, it is necessary to say which tool(s) the
   suppression is meaningful to.</para>

   <para>Tools will complain, at startup, if a tool does not
   understand any suppression directed to it.  Tools ignore
   suppressions which are not directed to them.  As a result, it
   is quite practical to put suppressions for all tools into the
   same suppression file.</para>

   <para>Valgrind's core can detect certain PThreads API errors,
   for which this line reads:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
core:PThread]]></programlisting>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Next line: a small number of suppression types have
   extra information after the second line (eg. the
   <computeroutput>Param</computeroutput> suppression for
   Memcheck)</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Remaining lines: This is the calling context for the
   error -- the chain of function calls that led to it.  There
   can be up to four of these lines.</para>

   <para>Locations may be either names of shared
   objects/executables or wildcards matching function names.
   They begin <computeroutput>obj:</computeroutput> and
   <computeroutput>fun:</computeroutput> respectively.  Function
   and object names to match against may use the wildcard
   characters <computeroutput>*</computeroutput> and
   <computeroutput>?</computeroutput>.</para>

   <formalpara><title>Important note:</title>
    <para>C++ function names must be <command>mangled</command>.
    If you are writing suppressions by hand, use the
    <computeroutput>--demangle=no</computeroutput> option to get
    the mangled names in your error messages.</para>
   </formalpara>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Finally, the entire suppression must be between curly
   braces. Each brace must be the first character on its own
   line.</para>
  </listitem>

 </itemizedlist>

<para>A suppression only suppresses an error when the error
matches all the details in the suppression.  Here's an
example:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
  __gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc
  Memcheck:Value4
  fun:__gconv_transform_ascii_internal
  fun:__mbr*toc
  fun:mbtowc
}]]></programlisting>


<para>What it means is: for Memcheck only, suppress a
use-of-uninitialised-value error, when the data size is 4, when
it occurs in the function
<computeroutput>__gconv_transform_ascii_internal</computeroutput>,
when that is called from any function of name matching
<computeroutput>__mbr*toc</computeroutput>, when that is called
from <computeroutput>mbtowc</computeroutput>.  It doesn't apply
under any other circumstances.  The string by which this
suppression is identified to the user is
<computeroutput>__gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>(See <xref linkend="mc-manual.suppfiles"/> for more details
on the specifics of Memcheck's suppression kinds.)</para>

<para>Another example, again for the Memcheck tool:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
  libX11.so.6.2/libX11.so.6.2/libXaw.so.7.0
  Memcheck:Value4
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so.7.0
}]]></programlisting>

<para>Suppress any size 4 uninitialised-value error which occurs
anywhere in <computeroutput>libX11.so.6.2</computeroutput>, when
called from anywhere in the same library, when called from
anywhere in <computeroutput>libXaw.so.7.0</computeroutput>.  The
inexact specification of locations is regrettable, but is about
all you can hope for, given that the X11 libraries shipped with
Red Hat 7.2 have had their symbol tables removed.</para>

<para>Note: since the above two examples did not make it clear,
you can freely mix the <computeroutput>obj:</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>fun:</computeroutput> styles of description
within a single suppression record.</para>

    <para><computeroutput>--demangle=yes</computeroutput> [default]</para>
    <para>Disable/enable automatic demangling (decoding) of C++
    names.  Enabled by default.  When enabled, Valgrind will
    attempt to translate encoded C++ procedure names back to
    something approaching the original.  The demangler handles
    symbols mangled by g++ versions 2.X and 3.X.</para>

    <para>An important fact about demangling is that function
    names mentioned in suppressions files should be in their
    mangled form.  Valgrind does not demangle function names when
    searching for applicable suppressions, because to do
    otherwise would make suppressions file contents dependent on
    the state of Valgrind's demangling machinery, and would also
    be slow and pointless.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para><computeroutput>--num-callers=&lt;number&gt;</computeroutput> [default=4]</para>
    <para>By default, Valgrind shows four levels of function call
    names to help you identify program locations.  You can change
    that number with this option.  This can help in determining
    the program's location in deeply-nested call chains.  Note
    that errors are commoned up using only the top three function
    locations (the place in the current function, and that of its
    two immediate callers).  So this doesn't affect the total
    number of errors reported.</para>

    <para>The maximum value for this is 50.  Note that higher
    settings will make Valgrind run a bit more slowly and take a
    bit more memory, but can be useful when working with programs
    with deeply-nested call chains.</para>

    <para>The prompt's behaviour is the same as for the

    <para>If you choose to, Valgrind will print out a suppression

    the future.</para>

    <para>When set to <computeroutput>all</computeroutput>, Valgrind
    will print a suppression for every reported error, without
    querying the user.</para>

    <para>This option is particularly useful with C++ programs,
    as it prints out the suppressions with mangled names, as
    required.</para>

    <para>Note that the suppressions printed are as specific as
    possible.  You may want to common up similar ones, eg. by
    adding wildcards to function names.  Also, sometimes two
    different errors are suppressed by the same suppression, in
    which case Valgrind will output the suppression more than
    once, but you only need to have one copy in your suppression
    file (but having more than one won't cause problems).  Also,
    the suppression name is given as <computeroutput>&lt;insert a
    suppression name here&gt;</computeroutput>; the name doesn't
    really matter, it's only used with the

 <sect2 id="manual-core.rareopts" xreflabel="Rare Options">
  <title>Rare Options</title>

  <para>These options apply to all tools, as they affect certain
  obscure workings of the Valgrind core.  Most people won't need
  to use these.</para>

  <itemizedlist>

   <listitem>
    <para><computeroutput>--run-libc-freeres=yes</computeroutput>
     [default]</para>
    <para><computeroutput>--run-libc-freeres=no</computeroutput></para>
    <para>The GNU C library
    (<computeroutput>libc.so</computeroutput>), which is used by
    all programs, may allocate memory for its own uses.  Usually
    it doesn't bother to free that memory when the program ends -
    there would be no point, since the Linux kernel reclaims all
    process resources when a process exits anyway, so it would
    just slow things down.</para>

    <para>The glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes
    leak checkers, such as Valgrind, to falsely report leaks in
    glibc, when a leak check is done at exit.  In order to avoid
    this, they provided a routine called
    <computeroutput>__libc_freeres</computeroutput> specifically
    to make glibc release all memory it has allocated.  Memcheck
    and Addrcheck therefore try and run
    <computeroutput>__libc_freeres</computeroutput> at
    exit.</para>

    <para>Unfortunately, in some versions of glibc,
    <computeroutput>__libc_freeres</computeroutput> is
    sufficiently buggy to cause segmentation faults.  This is
    particularly noticeable on Red Hat 7.1.  So this flag is
    provided in order to inhibit the run of
    <computeroutput>__libc_freeres</computeroutput>.  If your
    program seems to run fine on Valgrind, but segfaults at exit,
    you may find that
    <computeroutput>--run-libc-freeres=no</computeroutput> fixes
    that, although at the cost of possibly falsely reporting
    space leaks in
    <computeroutput>libc.so</computeroutput>.</para>

<sect1 id="manual-core.clientreq" 
       xreflabel="The Client Request mechanism">
<title>The Client Request mechanism</title>

<para>Valgrind has a trapdoor mechanism via which the client
program can pass all manner of requests and queries to Valgrind
and the current tool.  Internally, this is used extensively to
make malloc, free, signals, threads, etc, work, although you
don't see that.</para>

<para>For your convenience, a subset of these so-called client
requests is provided to allow you to tell Valgrind facts about
the behaviour of your program, and conversely to make queries.
In particular, your program can tell Valgrind about changes in
memory range permissions that Valgrind would not otherwise know
about, and so allows clients to get Valgrind to do arbitrary
custom checks.</para>

<para>Clients need to include a header file to make this work.
Which header file depends on which client requests you use.  Some
client requests are handled by the core, and are defined in the
header file <filename>valgrind.h</filename>.  Tool-specific
header files are named after the tool, e.g.
<filename>memcheck.h</filename>.  All header files can be found
in the <literal>include</literal> directory of wherever Valgrind
was installed.</para>

<para>The macros in these header files have the magical property
that they generate code in-line which Valgrind can spot.
However, the code does nothing when not run on Valgrind, so you
are not forced to run your program on Valgrind just because you
use the macros in this file.  Also, you are not required to link
your program with any extra supporting libraries.</para>

<para>Here is a brief description of the macros available in
<filename>valgrind.h</filename>, which work with more than one
tool (see the tool-specific documentation for explanations of the
tool-specific macros).</para>

   <term><computeroutput>VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS</computeroutput>:</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>discard translations of code in the specified address
    range.  Useful if you are debugging a JITter or some other
    dynamic code generation system.  After this call, attempts to
    execute code in the invalidated address range will cause
    Valgrind to make new translations of that code, which is
    probably the semantics you want.  Note that this is
    implemented naively, and involves checking all 200191 entries
    in the translation table to see if any of them overlap the
    specified address range.  So try not to call it often, or
    performance will nosedive.  Note that you can be clever about
    this: you only need to call it when an area which previously
    contained code is overwritten with new code.  You can choose
    to write coode into fresh memory, and just call this
    occasionally to discard large chunks of old code all at
    once.</para>

    when errors occur.  Only useful for tools that report errors,

<title>Support for POSIX Pthreads</title>

<para>Valgrind supports programs which use POSIX pthreads.
Getting this to work was technically challenging but it all works
well enough for significant threaded applications to work.</para>

<para>It works as follows: threaded apps are (dynamically) linked
against <literal>libpthread.so</literal>.  Usually this is the
one installed with your Linux distribution.  Valgrind, however,
supplies its own <literal>libpthread.so</literal> and
automatically connects your program to it instead.</para>

<para>The fake <literal>libpthread.so</literal> and Valgrind
cooperate to implement a user-space pthreads package.  This
approach avoids the horrible implementation problems of
implementing a truly multiprocessor version of Valgrind, but it
does mean that threaded apps run only on one CPU, even if you
have a multiprocessor machine.</para>

<para>Valgrind schedules your threads in a round-robin fashion,
with all threads having equal priority.  It switches threads
every 50000 basic blocks (typically around 300000 x86
instructions), which means you'll get a much finer interleaving
of thread executions than when run natively.  This in itself may
cause your program to behave differently if you have some kind of
concurrency, critical race, locking, or similar, bugs.</para>

<para>As of the Valgrind-1.0 release, the state of pthread
support was as follows:</para>

 <itemizedlist>

<sect1 id="manual-core.signals" xreflabel="Handling of Signals">
<title>Handling of Signals</title>

<para>Valgrind provides suitable handling of signals, so,
provided you stick to POSIX stuff, you should be ok.  Basic
sigaction() and sigprocmask() are handled.  Signal handlers may
return in the normal way or do longjmp(); both should work ok.
As specified by POSIX, a signal is blocked in its own handler.
Default actions for signals should work as before.  Etc,
etc.</para>

<para>Under the hood, dealing with signals is a real pain, and
Valgrind's simulation leaves much to be desired.  If your program
does way-strange stuff with signals, bad things may happen.  If
so, let us know.  We don't promise to fix it, but we'd at least
like to be aware of it.</para>

<sect1 id="manual-core.limits" xreflabel="Limitations">
<title>Limitations</title>

<para>The following list of limitations seems depressingly long.
However, most programs actually work fine.</para>

<para>Valgrind will run x86-GNU/Linux ELF dynamically linked
binaries, on a kernel 2.4.X or 2.6.X system, subject to
the following constraints:</para>

 <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
   <para>No support for 3DNow instructions.  If the translator
   encounters these, Valgrind will generate a SIGILL when the
   instruction is executed.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Pthreads support is improving, but there are still
   significant limitations in that department.  See the section
   above on Pthreads.  Note that your program must be dynamically
   linked against <literal>libpthread.so</literal>, so that
   Valgrind can substitute its own implementation at program
   startup time.  If you're statically linked against it, things
   will fail badly.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Memcheck assumes that the floating point registers are
   not used as intermediaries in memory-to-memory copies, so it
   immediately checks definedness of values loaded from memory by
   floating-point loads.  If you want to write code which copies
   around possibly-uninitialised values, you must ensure these
   travel through the integer registers, not the FPU.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>If your program does its own memory management, rather
   than using malloc/new/free/delete, it should still work, but
   Valgrind's error checking won't be so effective.  If you
   describe your program's memory management scheme using "client
   requests" (Section 3.7 of this manual), Memcheck can do
   better.  Nevertheless, using malloc/new and free/delete is
   still the best approach.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Valgrind's signal simulation is not as robust as it
   could be.  Basic POSIX-compliant sigaction and sigprocmask
   functionality is supplied, but it's conceivable that things
   could go badly awry if you do weird things with signals.
   Workaround: don't.  Programs that do non-POSIX signal tricks
   are in any case inherently unportable, so should be avoided if
   possible.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Programs which switch stacks are not well handled.
   Valgrind does have support for this, but I don't have great
   faith in it.  It's difficult -- there's no cast-iron way to
   decide whether a large change in %esp is as a result of the
   program switching stacks, or merely allocating a large object
   temporarily on the current stack -- yet Valgrind needs to
   handle the two situations differently.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>x86 instructions, and system calls, have been
   implemented on demand.  So it's possible, although unlikely,
   that a program will fall over with a message to that effect.
   If this happens, please report ALL the details printed out, so
   we can try and implement the missing feature.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>x86 floating point works correctly, but floating-point
   code may run even more slowly than integer code, due to my
   simplistic approach to FPU emulation.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Memory consumption of your program is majorly increased
   whilst running under Valgrind.  This is due to the large
   amount of administrative information maintained behind the
   scenes.  Another cause is that Valgrind dynamically translates
   the original executable.  Translated, instrumented code is
   14-16 times larger than the original (!) so you can easily end
   up with 30+ MB of translations when running (eg) a web
   browser.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Valgrind can handle dynamically-generated code just
   fine. However, if you regenerate code over the top of old code
   (ie. at the same memory addresses) Valgrind will not realise
   the code has changed, and will run its old translations, which
   will be out-of-date.  You need to use the
   VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS client request in that case. For
   the same reason gcc's <ulink
   url="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Nested-Functions.html">trampolines
   for nested functions</ulink> are currently unsupported, see

   <para>emacs starts up but immediately concludes it is out of
   memory and aborts.  Emacs has it's own memory-management

<sect1 id="manual-core.howworks" xreflabel="How It Works - A Rough Overview">
<title>How It Works -- A Rough Overview</title>

<para>Some gory details, for those with a passion for gory
details.  You don't need to read this section if all you want to
do is use Valgrind.  What follows is an outline of the machinery.
A more detailed (and somewhat out of date) description is to be
found <xref linkend="mc-tech-docs"/>.</para>

<sect2 id="manual-core.startb" xreflabel="Getting Started">
<title>Getting started</title>

<para>Valgrind is compiled into a shared object, valgrind.so.
The shell script valgrind sets the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable to point to valgrind.so.  This causes the .so to be
loaded as an extra library to any subsequently executed
dynamically-linked ELF binary, viz, the program you want to
debug.</para>

<para>The dynamic linker allows each .so in the process image to
have an initialisation function which is run before main().  It
also allows each .so to have a finalisation function run after
main() exits.</para>

<para>When valgrind.so's initialisation function is called by the
dynamic linker, the synthetic CPU to starts up.  The real CPU
remains locked in valgrind.so for the entire rest of the program,
but the synthetic CPU returns from the initialisation function.
Startup of the program now continues as usual -- the dynamic
linker calls all the other .so's initialisation routines, and
eventually runs main().  This all runs on the synthetic CPU, not
the real one, but the client program cannot tell the
difference.</para>

<para>Eventually main() exits, so the synthetic CPU calls
valgrind.so's finalisation function.  Valgrind detects this, and
uses it as its cue to exit.  It prints summaries of all errors
detected, possibly checks for memory leaks, and then exits the
finalisation routine, but now on the real CPU.  The synthetic CPU
has now lost control -- permanently -- so the program exits back
to the OS on the real CPU, just as it would have done
anyway.</para>

<para>On entry, Valgrind switches stacks, so it runs on its own
stack.  On exit, it switches back.  This means that the client
program continues to run on its own stack, so we can switch back
and forth between running it on the simulated and real CPUs
without difficulty.  This was an important design decision,
because it makes it easy (well, significantly less difficult) to
debug the synthetic CPU.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 id="manual-core.engine" 
       xreflabel="The translation/instrumentation engine">
<title>The translation/instrumentation engine</title>

<para>Valgrind does not directly run any of the original
program's code.  Only instrumented translations are run.
Valgrind maintains a translation table, which allows it to find
the translation quickly for any branch target (code address).  If
no translation has yet been made, the translator - a just-in-time
translator - is summoned.  This makes an instrumented
translation, which is added to the collection of translations.
Subsequent jumps to that address will use this
translation.</para>

<para>Valgrind no longer directly supports detection of
self-modifying code.  Such checking is expensive, and in practice
(fortunately) almost no applications need it.  However, to help
people who are debugging dynamic code generation systems, there
is a Client Request (basically a macro you can put in your
program) which directs Valgrind to discard translations in a
given address range.  So Valgrind can still work in this
situation provided the client tells it when code has become
out-of-date and needs to be retranslated.</para>

<para>The JITter translates basic blocks -- blocks of
straight-line-code -- as single entities.  To minimise the
considerable difficulties of dealing with the x86 instruction
set, x86 instructions are first translated to a RISC-like
intermediate code, similar to sparc code, but with an infinite
number of virtual integer registers.  Initially each insn is
translated seperately, and there is no attempt at
instrumentation.</para>

<para>The intermediate code is improved, mostly so as to try and
cache the simulated machine's registers in the real machine's
registers over several simulated instructions.  This is often
very effective.  Also, we try to remove redundant updates of the
simulated machines's condition-code register.</para>

<para>The intermediate code is then instrumented, giving more
intermediate code.  There are a few extra intermediate-code
operations to support instrumentation; it is all refreshingly
simple.  After instrumentation there is a cleanup pass to remove
redundant value checks.</para>

<para>This gives instrumented intermediate code which mentions
arbitrary numbers of virtual registers.  A linear-scan register
allocator is used to assign real registers and possibly generate
spill code.  All of this is still phrased in terms of the
intermediate code.  This machinery is inspired by the work of
Reuben Thomas (Mite).</para>

<para>Then, and only then, is the final x86 code emitted.  The
intermediate code is carefully designed so that x86 code can be
generated from it without need for spare registers or other
inconveniences.</para>

<para>The translations are managed using a traditional LRU-based
caching scheme.  The translation cache has a default size of
about 14MB.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 id="manual-core.track" 
       xreflabel="Tracking the Status of Memory">
<title>Tracking the Status of Memory</title>

<para>Each byte in the process' address space has nine bits
associated with it: one A bit and eight V bits.  The A and V bits
for each byte are stored using a sparse array, which flexibly and
efficiently covers arbitrary parts of the 32-bit address space
without imposing significant space or performance overheads for
the parts of the address space never visited.  The scheme used,
and speedup hacks, are described in detail at the top of the
source file <filename>coregrind/vg_memory.c</filename>, so you
should read that for the gory details.</para>

</sect2>



<sect2 id="manual-core.syscalls" xreflabel="System calls">
<title>System calls</title>

<para>All system calls are intercepted.  The memory status map is
consulted before and updated after each call.  It's all rather
tiresome.  See <filename>coregrind/vg_syscalls.c</filename> for
details.</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 id="manual-core.syssignals" xreflabel="Signals">
<title>Signals</title>

<para>All system calls to sigaction() and sigprocmask() are
intercepted.  If the client program is trying to set a signal
handler, Valgrind makes a note of the handler address and which
signal it is for.  Valgrind then arranges for the same signal to
be delivered to its own handler.</para>

<para>When such a signal arrives, Valgrind's own handler catches
it, and notes the fact.  At a convenient safe point in execution,
Valgrind builds a signal delivery frame on the client's stack and
runs its handler.  If the handler longjmp()s, there is nothing
more to be said.  If the handler returns, Valgrind notices this,
zaps the delivery frame, and carries on where it left off before
delivering the signal.</para>

<para>The purpose of this nonsense is that setting signal
handlers essentially amounts to giving callback addresses to the
Linux kernel.  We can't allow this to happen, because if it did,
signal handlers would run on the real CPU, not the simulated one.
This means the checking machinery would not operate during the
handler run, and, worse, memory permissions maps would not be
updated, which could cause spurious error reports once the
handler had returned.</para>

<para>An even worse thing would happen if the signal handler
longjmp'd rather than returned: Valgrind would completely lose
control of the client program.</para>

<para>Upshot: we can't allow the client to install signal
handlers directly.  Instead, Valgrind must catch, on behalf of
the client, any signal the client asks to catch, and must
delivery it to the client on the simulated CPU, not the real one.
This involves considerable gruesome fakery; see
<filename>coregrind/vg_signals.c</filename> for details.</para>

   As above, the 300 number is a compile-time constant.</para>

  <listitem>
   <para><computeroutput>Warning: client switching
   stacks?</computeroutput></para>
   <para>Valgrind spotted such a large change in the stack
   pointer, <literal>%esp</literal>, that it guesses the client
   is switching to a different stack.  At this point it makes a
   kludgey guess where the base of the new stack is, and sets
   memory permissions accordingly.  You may get many bogus error
   messages following this, if Valgrind guesses wrong.  At the
   moment "large change" is defined as a change of more that
   2000000 in the value of the <literal>%esp</literal> (stack
   pointer) register.</para>

  <listitem>
   <para><computeroutput>Warning: client attempted to close
   Valgrind's logfile fd &lt;number&gt;</computeroutput></para>
   <para>Valgrind doesn't allow the client to close the logfile,
   because you'd never see any diagnostic information after that
   point.  If you see this message, you may want to use the
   <computeroutput>--log-fd=&lt;number&gt;</computeroutput> option
   to specify a different logfile file-descriptor number.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para><computeroutput>Warning: noted but unhandled ioctl
   &lt;number&gt;</computeroutput></para>
   <para>Valgrind observed a call to one of the vast family of
   <computeroutput>ioctl</computeroutput> system calls, but did
   not modify its memory status info (because I have not yet got
   round to it).  The call will still have gone through, but you
   may get spurious errors after this as a result of the
   non-update of the memory info.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para><computeroutput>Warning: set address range perms: large
   range &lt;number></computeroutput></para>
   <para>Diagnostic message, mostly for benefit of the valgrind
   developers, to do with memory permissions.</para>
