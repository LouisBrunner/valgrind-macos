# How to create this file.
# - Generate with `pylint --generate-rcfile > pylintrc`. Do this in a directory
#   that doesn't already contain a `pylintrc` file, because the output is
#   affected by any existing `pylintrc` file.
# - Then modify entries resulting in unreasonable warnings.
#   - If a lint is never interesting, add it to the `disable=` list with an
#     explanatory comment.
#   - If a lint is interesting but needs modification, comment out the original
#     value, add a new value along with an explanatory comment.
# - Remove all non-modified entries.
