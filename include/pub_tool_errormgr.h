/* Call this when an error occurs.  It will be recorded if it hasn't been
   seen before.  If it has, the existing error record will have its count
   incremented.

   'tid' can be found as for VG_(record_ExeContext)().  The `s' string
   and `extra' field can be stack-allocated;  they will be copied by the core
   if needed (but it won't be copied if it's NULL).
   Note that `ekind' and `s' are also used to generate a suppression.
   `s' should therefore not contain data depending on the specific
   execution (such as addresses, values) but should rather contain
   e.g. a system call parameter symbolic name.
   `extra' is also (optionally) used for generating a suppression
   (see pub_tool_tooliface.h print_extra_suppression_info).

   If no 'a', 's' or 'extra' of interest needs to be recorded, just use
   NULL for them.

   ATTENTION: 's' should not contain information that is (too) specific
   to an instance of an error.  For example, 's' can clearly not contain
   an address, as otherwise no way the user can build a suppression entry
   matching such a variable error extra string.  It should preferrably not
   contain offset or array indexes, for similar reason.
   In other words, 's' should be NULL or should be a static string.
   Finally, if you change the string 's' from one release to another
   for the same error, you will introduce backward incompatible changes
   with the suppression files produced for previous releases.
   So, don't do that ! */

   hack that's useful sometimes if you just want to know if the error would
   be suppressed without possibly printing it.  'count_error' dictates
   whether to add the error in the error total count (another mild hack).
