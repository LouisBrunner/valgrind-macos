/*--- Vex's representation of the x86 CPU state.              ---*/
/*---------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* The integer parts should be pretty straightforward. */

/* Hmm, subregisters.  The simulated state is stored in memory in the
   host's byte ordering, so we can't say here what the offsets of %ax,
   %al, %ah etc are since that depends on the host's byte ordering,
   which we don't know. */

/* FPU.  For now, just simulate 8 64-bit registers, their tags, and
   the reg-stack top pointer, of which only the least significant
   three bits are relevant.

   The model is:
     F0 .. F7 are the 8 registers.  FTOP[2:0] contains the 
     index of the current 'stack top' -- pretty meaningless, but
     still.  FTOP is a 32-bit value.  FTOP[31:3] can be anything
     (not guaranteed to be zero).

     When a value is pushed onto the stack, ftop is first replaced by 
     (ftop-1) & 7, and then F[ftop] is assigned the value.

     When a value is popped off the stack, the value is read from
     F[ftop], and then ftop is replaced by (ftop+1) & 7.

     In general, a reference to a register ST(i) actually references
     F[ (ftop+i) & 7 ].

   FTAG0 .. FTAG0+7 are the tags.  Each is a byte, zero means empty,
   non-zero means non-empty.

   The general rule appears to be that a read or modify of a register
   gets a stack underflow fault if the register is empty.  A write of
   a register (only a write, not a modify) gets a stack overflow fault
   if the register is full.  Note that "over" vs "under" is pretty
   meaningless since the FP stack pointer can move around arbitrarily,
   so it's really just two different kinds of exceptions:
   register-empty and register full.

   Naturally Intel (in its infinite wisdom) has seen fit to throw in
   some ad-hoc inconsistencies to the fault-generation rules of the
   above para, just to complicate everything.  Known inconsistencies:

   * fxam can read a register in any state without taking an underflow
     fault.

   * fst from st(0) to st(i) does not take an overflow fault even if the
     destination is already full.

   FPROUND[1:0] is the FPU's notional rounding mode, encoded as per
   the IRRoundingMode type (see libvex_ir.h).  This just happens to be
   the Intel encoding.  Note carefully, the rounding mode is only
   observed on float-to-int conversions, and on float-to-float
   rounding, but not for general float-to-float operations, which are
   always rounded-to-nearest.

   Loads/stores of the FPU control word are faked accordingly -- on
   loads, everything except the rounding mode is ignored, and on
   stores, you get a vanilla control world (0x037F) with the rounding
   mode patched in.  Hence the only values you can get are 0x037F,
   0x077F, 0x0B7F or 0x0F7F.  Vex will emit an emulation warning if
   you try and load a control word which either (1) unmasks FP
   exceptions, or (2) changes the default (80-bit) precision.

   FC3210 contains the C3, C2, C1 and C0 bits in the same place they
   are in the FPU's status word.  (bits 14, 10, 9, 8 respectively).
   All other bits should be zero.  The relevant mask to select just
   those bits is 0x4700.  To select C3, C2 and C0 only, the mask is
   0x4500.  

   SSEROUND[1:0] is the SSE unit's notional rounding mode, encoded as
   per the IRRoundingMode type.  As with the FPU control word, the
   rounding mode is the only part of %MXCSR that Vex observes.  On
   storing %MXCSR, you will get a vanilla word (0x1F80) with the
   rounding mode patched in.  Hence the only values you will get are
   0x1F80, 0x3F80, 0x5F80 or 0x7F80.  Vex will emit an emulation
   warning if you try and load a control word which either (1) unmasks
   any exceptions, (2) sets FZ (flush-to-zero) to 1, or (3) sets DAZ
   (denormals-are-zeroes) to 1. 

   Segments: initial prefixes of local and global segment descriptor
   tables are modelled.  guest_LDT is either zero (NULL) or points in
   the host address space to an array of VEX_GUEST_X86_LDT_NENT
   descriptors, which have the type VexGuestX86SegDescr, defined
   below.  Similarly, guest_GDT is either zero or points in the host
   address space to an array of VEX_GUEST_X86_GDT_NENT descriptors.
   The only place where these are used are in the helper function
   x86g_use_seg().  LibVEX's client is responsible for pointing
   guest_LDT and guest_GDT at suitable tables.  The contents of these
   tables are expected not to change during the execution of any given
   superblock, but they may validly be changed by LibVEX's client in
   between superblock executions.

   Since x86g_use_seg() only expects these tables to have
   VEX_GUEST_X86_{LDT,GDT}_NENT entries, LibVEX's client should not
   attempt to write entries beyond those limits.
