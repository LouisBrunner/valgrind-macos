   of the full element data.
   Attention about the comparison function:
    * It must *not* compare the 'next' pointer.
    * when comparing the rest of the node, if the node data contains holes
      between components, either the node memory should be fully initialised
      (e.g. allocated using VG_(calloc)) or each component should be compared
       individually.
