<title>Using and understanding the Valgrind core</title>

<para>This chapter describes the Valgrind core services, command-line
options and behaviours.  That means it is relevant regardless of what
particular tool you are using.  The information should be sufficient for you
to make effective day-to-day use of Valgrind.  Advanced topics related to
the Valgrind core are described in <xref linkend="manual-core-adv"/>.
</para>

<para>
A point of terminology: most references to "Valgrind" in this chapter
refer to the Valgrind core services.  </para>



<sect1 id="manual-core.whatdoes" 
       xreflabel="What Valgrind does with your program">
<title>What Valgrind does with your program</title>

<para>Valgrind is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. It works
directly with existing executables. You don't need to recompile, relink,
or otherwise modify the program to be checked.</para>

<para>You invoke Valgrind like this:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
valgrind [valgrind-options] your-prog [your-prog-options]]]></programlisting>

<para>The most important option is <option>--tool</option> which dictates
which Valgrind tool to run.  For example, if want to run the command
<computeroutput>ls -l</computeroutput> using the memory-checking tool
Memcheck, issue this command:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
valgrind --tool=memcheck ls -l]]></programlisting>

<para>However, Memcheck is the default, so if you want to use it you can
omit the <option>--tool</option> option.</para>

<para>Regardless of which tool is in use, Valgrind takes control of your
program before it starts.  Debugging information is read from the
executable and associated libraries, so that error messages and other
outputs can be phrased in terms of source code locations, when
appropriate.</para>

<para>Your program is then run on a synthetic CPU provided by the
Valgrind core.  As new code is executed for the first time, the core
hands the code to the selected tool.  The tool adds its own
instrumentation code to this and hands the result back to the core,
which coordinates the continued execution of this instrumented
code.</para>

<para>The amount of instrumentation code added varies widely between
tools.  At one end of the scale, Memcheck adds code to check every
memory access and every value computed,
making it run 10-50 times slower than natively.
At the other end of the spectrum, the minimal tool, called Nulgrind,
adds no instrumentation at all and causes in total "only" about a 4 times
slowdown.</para>

<para>Valgrind simulates every single instruction your program executes.
Because of this, the active tool checks, or profiles, not only the code
in your application but also in all supporting dynamically-linked libraries,
including the C library, graphical libraries, and so on.</para>

<para>If you're using an error-detection tool, Valgrind may
detect errors in system libraries, for example the GNU C or X11
libraries, which you have to use.  You might not be interested in these
errors, since you probably have no control over that code.  Therefore,
Valgrind allows you to selectively suppress errors, by recording them in
a suppressions file which is read when Valgrind starts up.  The build
mechanism selects default suppressions which give reasonable
behaviour for the OS and libraries detected on your machine.
To make it easier to write suppressions, you can use the
<option>--gen-suppressions=yes</option> option.  This tells Valgrind to
print out a suppression for each reported error, which you can then
copy into a suppressions file.</para>

<para>Different error-checking tools report different kinds of errors.
The suppression mechanism therefore allows you to say which tool or
tool(s) each suppression applies to.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="manual-core.started" xreflabel="Getting started">
<title>Getting started</title>

<para>First off, consider whether it might be beneficial to recompile
your application and supporting libraries with debugging info enabled
(the <option>-g</option> option).  Without debugging info, the best
Valgrind tools will be able to do is guess which function a particular
piece of code belongs to, which makes both error messages and profiling
output nearly useless.  With <option>-g</option>, you'll get
messages which point directly to the relevant source code lines.</para>

<para>Another option you might like to consider, if you are working with
C++, is <option>-fno-inline</option>.  That makes it easier to see the
function-call chain, which can help reduce confusion when navigating
around large C++ apps.  For example, debugging
OpenOffice.org with Memcheck is a bit easier when using this option.  You
don't have to do this, but doing so helps Valgrind produce more accurate
and less confusing error reports.  Chances are you're set up like this
already, if you intended to debug your program with GNU GDB, or some
other debugger.</para>

<para>If you are planning to use Memcheck: On rare
occasions, compiler optimisations (at <option>-O2</option>
and above, and sometimes <option>-O1</option>) have been
observed to generate code which fools Memcheck into wrongly reporting
uninitialised value errors, or missing uninitialised value errors.  We have
looked in detail into fixing this, and unfortunately the result is that
doing so would give a further significant slowdown in what is already a slow
tool.  So the best solution is to turn off optimisation altogether.  Since
this often makes things unmanageably slow, a reasonable compromise is to use
<option>-O</option>.  This gets you the majority of the
benefits of higher optimisation levels whilst keeping relatively small the
chances of false positives or false negatives from Memcheck.  Also, you
should compile your code with <option>-Wall</option> because
it can identify some or all of the problems that Valgrind can miss at the
higher optimisation levels.  (Using <option>-Wall</option>
is also a good idea in general.)  All other tools (as far as we know) are
unaffected by optimisation level, and for profiling tools like Cachegrind it
is better to compile your program at its normal optimisation level.</para>

<para>Valgrind understands both the older "stabs" debugging format, used
by GCC versions prior to 3.1, and the newer DWARF2/3/4 formats
used by GCC
3.1 and later.  We continue to develop our debug-info readers,
although the majority of effort will naturally enough go into the newer
DWARF readers.</para>

<para>When you're ready to roll, run Valgrind as described above.
Note that you should run the real
(machine-code) executable here.  If your application is started by, for
example, a shell or Perl script, you'll need to modify it to invoke
Valgrind on the real executables.  Running such scripts directly under
Valgrind will result in you getting error reports pertaining to
<filename>/bin/sh</filename>,
<filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename>, or whatever interpreter
you're using.  This may not be what you want and can be confusing.  You
can force the issue by giving the option
<option>--trace-children=yes</option>, but confusion is still
likely.</para>

</sect1>


<!-- Referenced from both the manual and manpage -->
<sect1 id="&vg-comment-id;" xreflabel="&vg-comment-label;">
<title>The Commentary</title>

<para>Valgrind tools write a commentary, a stream of text, detailing
error reports and other significant events.  All lines in the commentary
have following form:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
==12345== some-message-from-Valgrind]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>The <computeroutput>12345</computeroutput> is the process ID.
This scheme makes it easy to distinguish program output from Valgrind
commentary, and also easy to differentiate commentaries from different
processes which have become merged together, for whatever reason.</para>

<para>By default, Valgrind tools write only essential messages to the
commentary, so as to avoid flooding you with information of secondary
importance.  If you want more information about what is happening,
re-run, passing the <option>-v</option> option to Valgrind.  A second
<option>-v</option> gives yet more detail.
</para>

<para>You can direct the commentary to three different places:</para>

<orderedlist>

  <listitem id="manual-core.out2fd" xreflabel="Directing output to fd">
    <para>The default: send it to a file descriptor, which is by default
    2 (stderr).  So, if you give the core no options, it will write
    commentary to the standard error stream.  If you want to send it to
    some other file descriptor, for example number 9, you can specify
    <option>--log-fd=9</option>.</para>

    <para>This is the simplest and most common arrangement, but can
    cause problems when Valgrinding entire trees of processes which
    expect specific file descriptors, particularly stdin/stdout/stderr,
    to be available for their own use.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem id="manual-core.out2file" 
            xreflabel="Directing output to file"> <para>A less intrusive
    option is to write the commentary to a file, which you specify by
    <option>--log-file=filename</option>.  There are special format
    specifiers that can be used to use a process ID or an environment
    variable name in the log file name.  These are useful/necessary if your
    program invokes multiple processes (especially for MPI programs).
    See the <link linkend="manual-core.basicopts">basic options section</link>
    for more details.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem id="manual-core.out2socket" 
            xreflabel="Directing output to network socket"> <para>The
    least intrusive option is to send the commentary to a network
    socket.  The socket is specified as an IP address and port number
    pair, like this: <option>--log-socket=192.168.0.1:12345</option> if
    you want to send the output to host IP 192.168.0.1 port 12345
    (note: we
    have no idea if 12345 is a port of pre-existing significance).  You
    can also omit the port number:
    <option>--log-socket=192.168.0.1</option>, in which case a default
    port of 1500 is used.  This default is defined by the constant
    <computeroutput>VG_CLO_DEFAULT_LOGPORT</computeroutput> in the
    sources.</para>

    <para>Note, unfortunately, that you have to use an IP address here,
    rather than a hostname.</para>

    <para>Writing to a network socket is pointless if you don't
    have something listening at the other end.  We provide a simple
    listener program,
    <computeroutput>valgrind-listener</computeroutput>, which accepts
    connections on the specified port and copies whatever it is sent to
    stdout.  Probably someone will tell us this is a horrible security
    risk.  It seems likely that people will write more sophisticated
    listeners in the fullness of time.</para>

    <para><computeroutput>valgrind-listener</computeroutput> can accept
    simultaneous connections from up to 50 Valgrinded processes.  In front
    of each line of output it prints the current number of active
    connections in round brackets.</para>

    <para><computeroutput>valgrind-listener</computeroutput> accepts two
    command-line options:</para>
    <!-- start of xi:include in the manpage -->
    <variablelist id="listener.opts.list">
       <varlistentry>
         <term><option>-e --exit-at-zero</option></term>
         <listitem>
           <para>When the number of connected processes falls back to zero,
           exit.  Without this, it will run forever, that is, until you
           send it Control-C.</para>
         </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
        <term><option>portnumber</option></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Changes the port it listens on from the default (1500).
          The specified port must be in the range 1024 to 65535.
          The same restriction applies to port numbers specified by a
          <option>--log-socket</option> to Valgrind itself.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <!-- end of xi:include in the manpage -->

    <para>If a Valgrinded process fails to connect to a listener, for
    whatever reason (the listener isn't running, invalid or unreachable
    host or port, etc), Valgrind switches back to writing the commentary
    to stderr.  The same goes for any process which loses an established
    connection to a listener.  In other words, killing the listener
    doesn't kill the processes sending data to it.</para>
  </listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>Here is an important point about the relationship between the
commentary and profiling output from tools.  The commentary contains a
mix of messages from the Valgrind core and the selected tool.  If the
tool reports errors, it will report them to the commentary.  However, if
the tool does profiling, the profile data will be written to a file of
some kind, depending on the tool, and independent of what
<option>--log-*</option> options are in force.  The commentary is
intended to be a low-bandwidth, human-readable channel.  Profiling data,
on the other hand, is usually voluminous and not meaningful without
further processing, which is why we have chosen this arrangement.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="manual-core.report" xreflabel="Reporting of errors">
<title>Reporting of errors</title>

<para>When an error-checking tool
detects something bad happening in the program, an error
message is written to the commentary.  Here's an example from Memcheck:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
==25832== Invalid read of size 4
==25832==    at 0x8048724: BandMatrix::ReSize(int, int, int) (bogon.cpp:45)
==25832==    by 0x80487AF: main (bogon.cpp:66)
==25832==  Address 0xBFFFF74C is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd]]></programlisting>

<para>This message says that the program did an illegal 4-byte read of
address 0xBFFFF74C, which, as far as Memcheck can tell, is not a valid
stack address, nor corresponds to any current heap blocks or recently freed
heap blocks.  The read is happening at line 45 of
<filename>bogon.cpp</filename>, called from line 66 of the same file,
etc.  For errors associated with an identified (current or freed) heap block,
for example reading freed memory, Valgrind reports not only the
location where the error happened, but also where the associated heap block
was allocated/freed.</para>

<para>Valgrind remembers all error reports.  When an error is detected,
it is compared against old reports, to see if it is a duplicate.  If so,
the error is noted, but no further commentary is emitted.  This avoids
you being swamped with bazillions of duplicate error reports.</para>

<para>If you want to know how many times each error occurred, run with
the <option>-v</option> option.  When execution finishes, all the
reports are printed out, along with, and sorted by, their occurrence
counts.  This makes it easy to see which errors have occurred most
frequently.</para>

<para>Errors are reported before the associated operation actually
happens.  For example, if you're using Memcheck and your program attempts to
read from address zero, Memcheck will emit a message to this effect, and
your program will then likely die with a segmentation fault.</para>

<para>In general, you should try and fix errors in the order that they
are reported.  Not doing so can be confusing.  For example, a program
which copies uninitialised values to several memory locations, and later
uses them, will generate several error messages, when run on Memcheck.
The first such error message may well give the most direct clue to the
root cause of the problem.</para>

<para>The process of detecting duplicate errors is quite an
expensive one and can become a significant performance overhead
if your program generates huge quantities of errors.  To avoid
serious problems, Valgrind will simply stop collecting
errors after 1,000 different errors have been seen, or 10,000,000 errors
in total have been seen.  In this situation you might as well
stop your program and fix it, because Valgrind won't tell you
anything else useful after this.  Note that the 1,000/10,000,000 limits
apply after suppressed errors are removed.  These limits are
defined in <filename>m_errormgr.c</filename> and can be increased
if necessary.</para>

<para>To avoid this cutoff you can use the
<option>--error-limit=no</option> option.  Then Valgrind will always show
errors, regardless of how many there are.  Use this option carefully,
since it may have a bad effect on performance.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="manual-core.suppress" xreflabel="Suppressing errors">
<title>Suppressing errors</title>

<para>The error-checking tools detect numerous problems in the system
libraries, such as the C library, 
which come pre-installed with your OS.  You can't easily fix
these, but you don't want to see these errors (and yes, there are many!)
So Valgrind reads a list of errors to suppress at startup.  A default
suppression file is created by the
<computeroutput>./configure</computeroutput> script when the system is
built.</para>

<para>You can modify and add to the suppressions file at your leisure,
or, better, write your own.  Multiple suppression files are allowed.
This is useful if part of your project contains errors you can't or
don't want to fix, yet you don't want to continuously be reminded of
them.</para>

<formalpara><title>Note:</title> <para>By far the easiest way to add
suppressions is to use the <option>--gen-suppressions=yes</option> option
described in <xref linkend="manual-core.options"/>.  This generates
suppressions automatically.  For best results,
though, you may want to edit the output
    of  <option>--gen-suppressions=yes</option> by hand, in which
case it would be advisable to read through this section.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>Each error to be suppressed is described very specifically, to
minimise the possibility that a suppression-directive inadvertently
suppresses a bunch of similar errors which you did want to see.  The
suppression mechanism is designed to allow precise yet flexible
specification of errors to suppress.</para>

<para>If you use the <option>-v</option> option, at the end of execution,
Valgrind prints out one line for each used suppression, giving the number of times
it got used, its name and the filename and line number where the suppression is
defined. Depending on the suppression kind, the filename and line number are optionally
followed by additional information (such as the number of blocks and bytes suppressed
by a memcheck leak suppression). Here's the suppressions used by a
run of <computeroutput>valgrind -v --tool=memcheck ls -l</computeroutput>:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
--1610-- used_suppression:      2 dl-hack3-cond-1 /usr/lib/valgrind/default.supp:1234
--1610-- used_suppression:      2 glibc-2.5.x-on-SUSE-10.2-(PPC)-2a /usr/lib/valgrind/default.supp:1234
]]></programlisting>

<para>Multiple suppressions files are allowed.  By default, Valgrind
uses <filename>$PREFIX/lib/valgrind/default.supp</filename>.  You can
ask to add suppressions from another file, by specifying
<option>--suppressions=/path/to/file.supp</option>.
</para>

<para>If you want to understand more about suppressions, look at an
existing suppressions file whilst reading the following documentation.
The file <filename>glibc-2.3.supp</filename>, in the source
distribution, provides some good examples.</para>

<para>Each suppression has the following components:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>First line: its name.  This merely gives a handy name to the
    suppression, by which it is referred to in the summary of used
    suppressions printed out when a program finishes.  It's not
    important what the name is; any identifying string will do.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Second line: name of the tool(s) that the suppression is for
    (if more than one, comma-separated), and the name of the suppression
    itself, separated by a colon (n.b.: no spaces are allowed), eg:</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
tool_name1,tool_name2:suppression_name]]></programlisting>

    <para>Recall that Valgrind is a modular system, in which
    different instrumentation tools can observe your program whilst it
    is running.  Since different tools detect different kinds of errors,
    it is necessary to say which tool(s) the suppression is meaningful
    to.</para>

    <para>Tools will complain, at startup, if a tool does not understand
    any suppression directed to it.  Tools ignore suppressions which are
    not directed to them.  As a result, it is quite practical to put
    suppressions for all tools into the same suppression file.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Next line: a small number of suppression types have extra
    information after the second line (eg. the <varname>Param</varname>
    suppression for Memcheck)</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Remaining lines: This is the calling context for the error --
    the chain of function calls that led to it.  There can be up to 24
    of these lines.</para>

    <para>Locations may be names of either shared objects or
    functions.  They begin
    <computeroutput>obj:</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>fun:</computeroutput> respectively.  Function and
    object names to match against may use the wildcard characters
    <computeroutput>*</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>?</computeroutput>.</para>

    <para><command>Important note: </command> C++ function names must be
    <command>mangled</command>.  If you are writing suppressions by
    hand, use the <option>--demangle=no</option> option to get the
    mangled names in your error messages.  An example of a mangled
    C++ name is  <computeroutput>_ZN9QListView4showEv</computeroutput>.
    This is the form that the GNU C++ compiler uses internally, and
    the form that must be used in suppression files.  The equivalent
    demangled name, <computeroutput>QListView::show()</computeroutput>,
    is what you see at the C++ source code level.
    </para>

    <para>A location line may also be
    simply "<computeroutput>...</computeroutput>" (three dots).  This is
    a frame-level wildcard, which matches zero or more frames.  Frame
    level wildcards are useful because they make it easy to ignore
    varying numbers of uninteresting frames in between frames of
    interest.  That is often important when writing suppressions which
    are intended to be robust against variations in the amount of
    function inlining done by compilers.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Finally, the entire suppression must be between curly
    braces. Each brace must be the first character on its own
    line.</para>
  </listitem>

 </itemizedlist>

<para>A suppression only suppresses an error when the error matches all
the details in the suppression.  Here's an example:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
  __gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc
  Memcheck:Value4
  fun:__gconv_transform_ascii_internal
  fun:__mbr*toc
  fun:mbtowc
}]]></programlisting>


<para>What it means is: for Memcheck only, suppress a
use-of-uninitialised-value error, when the data size is 4, when it
occurs in the function
<computeroutput>__gconv_transform_ascii_internal</computeroutput>, when
that is called from any function of name matching
<computeroutput>__mbr*toc</computeroutput>, when that is called from
<computeroutput>mbtowc</computeroutput>.  It doesn't apply under any
other circumstances.  The string by which this suppression is identified
to the user is
<computeroutput>__gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>(See <xref linkend="mc-manual.suppfiles"/> for more details
on the specifics of Memcheck's suppression kinds.)</para>

<para>Another example, again for the Memcheck tool:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
  libX11.so.6.2/libX11.so.6.2/libXaw.so.7.0
  Memcheck:Value4
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so.7.0
}]]></programlisting>

<para>This suppresses any size 4 uninitialised-value error which occurs
anywhere in <filename>libX11.so.6.2</filename>, when called from
anywhere in the same library, when called from anywhere in
<filename>libXaw.so.7.0</filename>.  The inexact specification of
locations is regrettable, but is about all you can hope for, given that
the X11 libraries shipped on the Linux distro on which this example
was made have had their symbol tables removed.</para>

<para>Although the above two examples do not make this clear, you can
freely mix <computeroutput>obj:</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>fun:</computeroutput> lines in a suppression.</para>

<para>Finally, here's an example using three frame-level wildcards:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{
   a-contrived-example
   Memcheck:Leak
   fun:malloc
   ...
   fun:ddd
   ...
   fun:ccc
   ...
   fun:main
}
]]></programlisting>
This suppresses Memcheck memory-leak errors, in the case where
the allocation was done by <computeroutput>main</computeroutput>
calling (though any number of intermediaries, including zero)
<computeroutput>ccc</computeroutput>,
calling onwards via
<computeroutput>ddd</computeroutput> and eventually
to <computeroutput>malloc.</computeroutput>.

        This can be useful for pruning uninteresting branches from a
        tree of processes being run on Valgrind.  But you should be
        careful when using it.  When Valgrind skips tracing into an
        executable, it doesn't just skip tracing that executable, it
        also skips tracing any of that executable's child processes.
        In other words, the flag doesn't merely cause tracing to stop
        at the specified executables -- it skips tracing of entire
        process subtrees rooted at any of the specified
        executables.</para>

      <para><option>%p</option> is replaced with the current process ID.

      (or the <option>%q</option> specifier below), the Valgrind output from

      <option>{FOO}</option> part is malformed, it causes an abort.  This
      specifier is rarely needed, but very useful in certain circumstances
      (eg. when running MPI programs).  The idea is that you specify a
      variable which will be set differently for each process in the job,
      for example <computeroutput>BPROC_RANK</computeroutput> or whatever is
      applicable in your MPI setup.  If the named environment variable is not

      <para>If an <option>%</option> is followed by any other character, it

      <para>If the file name specifies a relative file name, it is put

      directory when the program started its execution after the fork
      or after the exec.  If it specifies an absolute file name (ie.

      <para>Stack-scanning support is available only on ARM
      targets.</para>

      <para>These flags enable and control stack unwinding by stack
      scanning.  When the normal stack unwinding mechanisms -- usage
      of Dwarf CFI records, and frame-pointer following -- fail, stack
      scanning may be able to recover a stack trace.</para>

      <para>Note that stack scanning is an imprecise, heuristic
      mechanism that may give very misleading results, or none at all.
      It should be used only in emergencies, when normal unwinding
      fails, and it is important to nevertheless have stack
      traces.</para>

      <para>Stack scanning is a simple technique: the unwinder reads
      words from the stack, and tries to guess which of them might be
      return addresses, by checking to see if they point just after
      ARM or Thumb call instructions.  If so, the word is added to the
      backtrace.</para>

      <para>The main danger occurs when a function call returns,
      leaving its return address exposed, and a new function is
      called, but the new function does not overwrite the old address.
      The result of this is that the backtrace may contain entries for
      functions which have already returned, and so be very
      confusing.</para>

      <para>A second limitation of this implementation is that it will
      scan only the page (4KB, normally) containing the starting stack
      pointer.  If the stack frames are large, this may result in only
      a few (or not even any) being present in the trace.  Also, if
      you are unlucky and have an initial stack pointer near the end
      of its containing page, the scan may miss all interesting
      frames.</para>

      <para>By default stack scanning is disabled.  The normal use
      case is to ask for it when a stack trace would otherwise be very
      short.  So, to enable it,
      use <computeroutput>--unw-stack-scan-thresh=number</computeroutput>.
      This requests Valgrind to try using stack scanning to "extend"
      stack traces which contain fewer
      than <computeroutput>number</computeroutput> frames.</para>

      <para>If stack scanning does take place, it will only generate
      at most the number of frames specified
      by <computeroutput>--unw-stack-scan-frames</computeroutput>.
      Typically, stack scanning generates so many garbage entries that

    </term>
    <listitem>
      <para>By default Valgrind only shows the filenames in stack
      traces, but not full paths to source files.  When using Valgrind
      in large projects where the sources reside in multiple different
      directories, this can be inconvenient.
      <option>--fullpath-after</option> provides a flexible solution
      to this problem.  When this option is present, the path to each
      source file is shown, with the following all-important caveat:
      if <option>string</option> is found in the path, then the path
      up to and including <option>string</option> is omitted, else the
      path is shown unmodified.  Note that <option>string</option> is
      not required to be a prefix of the path.</para>

      <para>For example, consider a file named
      <computeroutput>/home/janedoe/blah/src/foo/bar/xyzzy.c</computeroutput>.
      Specifying <option>--fullpath-after=/home/janedoe/blah/src/</option>
      will cause Valgrind to show the name
      as <computeroutput>foo/bar/xyzzy.c</computeroutput>.</para>

      <para>Because the string is not required to be a prefix,
      <option>--fullpath-after=src/</option> will produce the same
      output.  This is useful when the path contains arbitrary
      machine-generated characters.  For example, the
      path
      <computeroutput>/my/build/dir/C32A1B47/blah/src/foo/xyzzy</computeroutput>
      can be pruned to <computeroutput>foo/xyzzy</computeroutput>
      using
      <option>--fullpath-after=/blah/src/</option>.</para>

      <para>If you simply want to see the full path, just specify an
      empty string: <option>--fullpath-after=</option>.  This isn't a
      special case, merely a logical consequence of the above rules.</para>

      <para>Finally, you can use <option>--fullpath-after</option>
      multiple times.  Any appearance of it causes Valgrind to switch
      to producing full paths and applying the above filtering rule.
      Each produced path is compared against all
      the <option>--fullpath-after</option>-specified strings, in the
      order specified.  The first string to match causes the path to
      be truncated as described above.  If none match, the full path
      is shown.  This facilitates chopping off prefixes when the
      sources are drawn from a number of unrelated directories.

      <para>However, there may be scenarios where you may wish to put
      debug objects at an arbitrary location, such as external storage
      when running Valgrind on a mobile device with limited local
      storage.  Another example might be a situation where you do not
      have permission to install debug object packages on the system
      where you are running Valgrind.</para>

      <para>In these scenarios, you may provide an absolute path as an extra,
      final place for Valgrind to search for debug objects by specifying
      <option>--extra-debuginfo-path=/path/to/debug/objects</option>.
      The given path will be prepended to the absolute path name of

      for <computeroutput>/w/x/y/zz.so</computeroutput>
      and <option>--extra-debuginfo-path=/a/b/c</option> is specified,

      <para>In some scenarios it may be convenient to read debuginfo

      Valgrind will query a debuginfo server running

      the debuginfo object in the local filesystem.</para>

      <para>The debuginfo server must accept TCP connections on

      server is contained in the source
      file <computeroutput>auxprogs/valgrind-di-server.c</computeroutput>.
      It will only serve from the directory it is started
      in.  <computeroutput>port</computeroutput> defaults to 1500 in
      both client and server if not specified.</para>

      <para>If Valgrind looks for the debuginfo for
      <computeroutput>/w/x/y/zz.so</computeroutput> by using the
      debuginfo server, it will strip the pathname components and
      merely request <computeroutput>zz.so</computeroutput> on the
      server.  That in turn will look only in its current working
      directory for a matching debuginfo object.</para>

      <para>The debuginfo data is transmitted in small fragments (8
      KB) as requested by Valgrind.  Each block is compressed using
      LZO to reduce transmission time.  The implementation has been
      tuned for best performance over a single-stage 802.11g (WiFi)
      network link.</para>

      <para>Note that checks for matching primary vs debug objects,

      Instead, the debuginfo must be linked manually by

      most likely because it is out of date.  In these cases, Valgrind

      <para>With <option>--dsymutil=yes</option>, Valgrind
      will, in such cases, automatically
      run <computeroutput>dsymutil</computeroutput> as necessary to
      bring the debuginfo up to date.  For all practical purposes, if

      <para>You may need to use this option if your program has large

      change smaller than the threshold.  Usually this heuristic works
      well.  However, if your program allocates large structures on the

      because the error checking performed by Memcheck is more effective

      it as high as you need, since reserving far more space than you
      need (that is, hundreds of megabytes more than you need)
      constrains Valgrind's memory allocators and may reduce the total
      amount of memory that Valgrind can use.  This is only really of
      significance on 32-bit machines.</para>

      <para>On Linux, you may request a stack of size up to 2GB.
      Valgrind will stop with a diagnostic message if the stack cannot
      be allocated.</para>

      <para><option>--main-stacksize</option> only affects the stack
      size for the program's initial thread.  It has no bearing on the
      size of thread stacks, as Valgrind does not allocate
      those.</para>

      <para>You may need to use both <option>--main-stacksize</option>
      and <option>--max-stackframe</option> together.  It is important
      to understand that <option>--main-stacksize</option> sets the
      maximum total stack size,
      whilst <option>--max-stackframe</option> specifies the largest
      size of any one stack frame.  You will have to work out
      the <option>--main-stacksize</option> value for yourself
      (usually, if your applications segfaults).  But Valgrind will
      tell you the needed <option>--max-stackframe</option> size, if
      necessary.</para>

      <para>As discussed further in the description
      of <option>--max-stackframe</option>, a requirement for a large
      stack is a sign of potential portability problems.  You are best
      advised to place all large data in heap-allocated memory.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>This option controls Valgrind's detection of self-modifying
      code.  If no checking is done, if a program executes some code, then
      overwrites it with new code, and executes the new code, Valgrind will
      continue to execute the translations it made for the old code.  This
      will likely lead to incorrect behaviour and/or crashes.</para>
      
      <para>Valgrind has four levels of self-modifying code detection:
      no detection, detect self-modifying code on the stack (which is used by
      GCC to implement nested functions), detect self-modifying code
      everywhere, and detect self-modifying code everywhere except in
      file-backed mappings.

      Note that the default option will catch the vast majority
      of cases.  The main case it will not catch is programs such as JIT
      compilers that dynamically generate code <emphasis>and</emphasis>
      subsequently overwrite part or all of it.  Running with
      <varname>all</varname> will slow Valgrind down noticeably.
      Running with
      <varname>none</varname> will rarely speed things up, since very little
      code gets put on the stack for most programs.  The
      <function>VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS</function> client
      request is an alternative to <option>--smc-check=all</option>
      that requires more programmer effort but allows Valgrind to run
      your program faster, by telling it precisely when translations
      need to be re-made.

      <para><option>--smc-check=all-non-file</option> provides a
      cheaper but more limited version
      of <option>--smc-check=all</option>.  It adds checks to any
      translations that do not originate from file-backed memory
      mappings.  Typical applications that generate code, for example
      JITs in web browsers, generate code into anonymous mmaped areas,
      whereas the "fixed" code of the browser always lives in
      file-backed mappings.  <option>--smc-check=all-non-file</option>
      takes advantage of this observation, limiting the overhead of
      checking to code which is likely to be JIT generated.</para>

      <para>Some architectures (including ppc32, ppc64, ARM and MIPS)
      require programs which create code at runtime to flush the
      instruction cache in between code generation and first use.
      Valgrind observes and honours such instructions.  Hence, on
      ppc32/Linux, ppc64/Linux and ARM/Linux, Valgrind always provides
      complete, transparent support for self-modifying code.  It is
      only on platforms such as x86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, x86/Darwin and
      AMD64/Darwin that you need to use this option.</para>

      <para>This option is only relevant when running Valgrind on Linux.</para>

      <para>The GNU C library (<function>libc.so</function>), which is
      used by all programs, may allocate memory for its own uses.
      Usually it doesn't bother to free that memory when the program
      ends&mdash;there would be no point, since the Linux kernel reclaims
      all process resources when a process exits anyway, so it would
      just slow things down.</para>

      <para>The glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes leak
      checkers, such as Valgrind, to falsely report leaks in glibc, when
      a leak check is done at exit.  In order to avoid this, they
      provided a routine called <function>__libc_freeres</function>
      specifically to make glibc release all memory it has allocated.
      Memcheck therefore tries to run
      <function>__libc_freeres</function> at exit.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, in some very old versions of glibc,
      <function>__libc_freeres</function> is sufficiently buggy to cause
      segmentation faults.  This was particularly noticeable on Red Hat
      7.1.  So this option is provided in order to inhibit the run of
      <function>__libc_freeres</function>.  If your program seems to run
      fine on Valgrind, but segfaults at exit, you may find that
      <option>--run-libc-freeres=no</option> fixes that, although at the
      cost of possibly falsely reporting space leaks in

      <para>Valgrind translates and instruments your program's machine
      code in small fragments. The translations are stored in a
      translation cache that is divided into a number of sections
      (sectors). If the cache is full, the sector containing the
      oldest translations is emptied and reused. If these old
      translations are needed again, Valgrind must re-translate and
      re-instrument the corresponding machine code, which is
      expensive.  If the "executed instructions" working set of a
      program is big, increasing the number of sectors may improve
      performance by reducing the number of re-translations needed.
      Sectors are allocated on demand.  Once allocated, a sector can
      never be freed, and occupies considerable space, depending on the tool
      (about 40 MB per sector for Memcheck).  Use the

      <para>To avoid potential conflicts with some system libraries,
      Valgrind does not use the address space
      below <option>--aspace-minaddr</option> value, keeping it
      reserved in case a library specifically requests memory in this
      region.  So, some "pessimistic" value is guessed by Valgrind
      depending on the platform. On linux, by default, Valgrind avoids
      using the first 64MB even if typically there is no conflict in
      this complete zone.  You can use the
      option <option>--aspace-minaddr</option> to have your memory
      hungry application benefitting from more of this lower memory.
      On the other hand, if you encounter a conflict, increasing
      aspace-minaddr value might solve it. Conflicts will typically
      manifest themselves with mmap failures in the low range of the
      address space. The
      provided <computeroutput>address</computeroutput> must be page

      <para>When a shared object whose soname
      matches <varname>sonamepatt</varname> is loaded into the
      process, examine all the text symbols it exports.  If none of
      those match <varname>fnnamepatt</varname>, print an error
      message and abandon the run.  This makes it possible to ensure
      that the run does not continue unless a given shared object
      contains a particular function name.
      </para>
      <para>
      Both <varname>sonamepatt</varname> and
      <varname>fnnamepatt</varname> can be written using the usual
      <varname>?</varname> and <varname>*</varname> wildcards.  For
      example: <varname>":*libc.so*:foo?bar"</varname>.  You may use
      characters other than a colon to separate the two patterns.  It
      is only important that the first character and the separator
      character are the same.  For example, the above example could
      also be written <varname>"Q*libc.so*Qfoo?bar"</varname>.
      Multiple <varname> --require-text-symbol</varname> flags are
      allowed, in which case shared objects that are loaded into
      the process will be checked against all of them.
      </para>
      <para>
      The purpose of this is to support reliable usage of marked-up
      libraries.  For example, suppose we have a version of GCC's
      <varname>libgomp.so</varname> which has been marked up with
      annotations to support Helgrind.  It is only too easy and
      confusing to load the wrong, un-annotated
      <varname>libgomp.so</varname> into the application.  So the idea
      is: add a text symbol in the marked-up library, for
      example <varname>annotated_for_helgrind_3_6</varname>, and then
      give the flag
      <varname>--require-text-symbol=:*libgomp*so*:annotated_for_helgrind_3_6</varname>
      so that when <varname>libgomp.so</varname> is loaded, Valgrind
      scans its symbol table, and if the symbol isn't present the run
      is aborted, rather than continuing silently with the
      un-marked-up library.  Note that you should put the entire flag
      in quotes to stop shells expanding up the <varname>*</varname>
      and <varname>?</varname> wildcards.

      <para>When a shared library is loaded, Valgrind checks for 
      functions in the library that must be replaced or wrapped.
      For example, Memcheck replaces all malloc related
      functions (malloc, free, calloc, ...) with its own versions.
      Such replacements are done by default only in shared libraries whose
      soname matches a predefined soname pattern (e.g.
      <varname>libc.so*</varname> on linux).
      By default, no replacement is done for a statically linked
      library or for alternative libraries such as tcmalloc.
      In some cases, the replacements allow
      <option>--soname-synonyms</option> to specify one additional
      synonym pattern, giving flexibility in the replacement. </para>

      <para>Currently, this flexibility is only allowed for the
      malloc related functions, using the
      synonym <varname>somalloc</varname>.  This synonym is usable for
      all tools doing standard replacement of malloc related functions
      (e.g. memcheck, massif, drd, helgrind, exp-dhat, exp-sgcheck).

          A pattern can be used to match multiple libraries sonames.
          For

<sect1 id="manual-core.pthreads" xreflabel="Support for Threads">
<title>Support for Threads</title>

<para>Threaded programs are fully supported.</para>

<para>The main thing to point out with respect to threaded programs is
that your program will use the native threading library, but Valgrind
serialises execution so that only one (kernel) thread is running at a
time.  This approach avoids the horrible implementation problems of
implementing a truly multithreaded version of Valgrind, but it does
mean that threaded apps never use more than one CPU simultaneously,
even if you have a multiprocessor or multicore machine.</para>

<para>Valgrind doesn't schedule the threads itself.  It merely ensures
that only one thread runs at once, using a simple locking scheme.  The
actual thread scheduling remains under control of the OS kernel.  What
this does mean, though, is that your program will see very different
scheduling when run on Valgrind than it does when running normally.
This is both because Valgrind is serialising the threads, and because
the code runs so much slower than normal.</para>

<para>This difference in scheduling may cause your program to behave
differently, if you have some kind of concurrency, critical race,
locking, or similar, bugs.  In that case you might consider using the
tools Helgrind and/or DRD to track them down.</para>

<para>On Linux, Valgrind also supports direct use of the
<computeroutput>clone</computeroutput> system call,
<computeroutput>futex</computeroutput> and so on.
<computeroutput>clone</computeroutput> is supported where either
everything is shared (a thread) or nothing is shared (fork-like); partial
sharing will fail.
</para>

<sect2 id="&vg-pthreads-perf-sched-id;" xreflabel="&vg-pthreads-perf-sched-label;">
<title>Scheduling and Multi-Thread Performance</title>

<para>A thread executes code only when it holds the abovementioned
lock.  After executing some number of instructions, the running thread
will release the lock.  All threads ready to run will then compete to
acquire the lock.</para>

<para>The <option>--fair-sched</option> option controls the locking mechanism
used to serialise thread execution.</para>

<para>The default pipe based locking mechanism
(<option>--fair-sched=no</option>) is available on all
platforms.  Pipe based locking does not guarantee fairness between
threads: it is quite likely that a thread that has just released the
lock reacquires it immediately, even though other threads are ready to
run.  When using pipe based locking, different runs of the same
multithreaded application might give very different thread
scheduling.</para>

<para>An alternative locking mechanism, based on futexes, is available
on some platforms.  If available, it is activated
by <option>--fair-sched=yes</option> or
<option>--fair-sched=try</option>.  Futex based locking ensures
fairness (round-robin scheduling) between threads: if multiple threads
are ready to run, the lock will be given to the thread which first
requested the lock.  Note that a thread which is blocked in a system
call (e.g. in a blocking read system call) has not (yet) requested the
lock: such a thread requests the lock only after the system call is
finished.</para>

<para> The fairness of the futex based locking produces better
reproducibility of thread scheduling for different executions of a
multithreaded application. This better reproducibility is particularly
helpful when using Helgrind or DRD.</para>

<para>Valgrind's use of thread serialisation implies that only one
thread at a time may run.  On a multiprocessor/multicore system, the
running thread is assigned to one of the CPUs by the OS kernel
scheduler.  When a thread acquires the lock, sometimes the thread will
be assigned to the same CPU as the thread that just released the
lock.  Sometimes, the thread will be assigned to another CPU.  When
using pipe based locking, the thread that just acquired the lock
will usually be scheduled on the same CPU as the thread that just
released the lock.  With the futex based mechanism, the thread that
just acquired the lock will more often be scheduled on another
CPU.</para>

<para>Valgrind's thread serialisation and CPU assignment by the OS
kernel scheduler can interact badly with the CPU frequency scaling
available on many modern CPUs.  To decrease power consumption, the
frequency of a CPU or core is automatically decreased if the CPU/core
has not been used recently.  If the OS kernel often assigns the thread
which just acquired the lock to another CPU/core, it is quite likely
that this CPU/core is currently at a low frequency.  The frequency of
this CPU will be increased after some time.  However, during this
time, the (only) running thread will have run at the low frequency.
Once this thread has run for some time, it will release the lock.
Another thread will acquire this lock, and might be scheduled again on
another CPU whose clock frequency was decreased in the
meantime.</para>

<para>The futex based locking causes threads to change CPUs/cores more
often.  So, if CPU frequency scaling is activated, the futex based
locking might decrease significantly the performance of a
multithreaded app running under Valgrind.  Performance losses of up to
50% degradation have been observed, as compared to running on a
machine for which CPU frequency scaling has been disabled.  The pipe
based locking locking scheme also interacts badly with CPU frequency
scaling, with performance losses in the range 10..20% having been
observed.</para>

<para>To avoid such performance degradation, you should indicate to
the kernel that all CPUs/cores should always run at maximum clock
speed.  Depending on your Linux distribution, CPU frequency scaling
may be controlled using a graphical interface or using command line
such as
<computeroutput>cpufreq-selector</computeroutput> or
<computeroutput>cpufreq-set</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>An alternative way to avoid these problems is to tell the
OS scheduler to tie a Valgrind process to a specific (fixed) CPU using the
<computeroutput>taskset</computeroutput> command.  This should ensure
that the selected CPU does not fall below its maximum frequency
setting so long as any thread of the program has work to do.

subject to the following constraints:</para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>On x86 and amd64, there is no support for 3DNow!
   instructions.  If the translator encounters these, Valgrind will
   generate a SIGILL when the instruction is executed.  Apart from
   that, on x86 and amd64, essentially all instructions are supported,
   up to and including AVX and AES in 64-bit mode and SSSE3 in 32-bit
   mode.  32-bit mode does in fact support the bare minimum SSE4
   instructions to needed to run programs on MacOSX 10.6 on 32-bit
   targets.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>On ppc32 and ppc64, almost all integer, floating point and
   Altivec instructions are supported.  Specifically: integer and FP
   insns that are mandatory for PowerPC, the "General-purpose
   optional" group (fsqrt, fsqrts, stfiwx), the "Graphics optional"
   group (fre, fres, frsqrte, frsqrtes), and the Altivec (also known
   as VMX) SIMD instruction set, are supported.  Also, instructions
   from the Power ISA 2.05 specification, as present in POWER6 CPUs,

    complete.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>If your program does its own memory management, rather than
   using malloc/new/free/delete, it should still work, but Memcheck's
   error checking won't be so effective.  If you describe your
   program's memory management scheme using "client requests" (see
   <xref linkend="manual-core-adv.clientreq"/>), Memcheck can do
   better.  Nevertheless, using malloc/new and free/delete is still
   the best approach.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Valgrind's signal simulation is not as robust as it could be.
   Basic POSIX-compliant sigaction and sigprocmask functionality is
   supplied, but it's conceivable that things could go badly awry if you
   do weird things with signals.  Workaround: don't.  Programs that do
   non-POSIX signal tricks are in any case inherently unportable, so
   should be avoided if possible.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Machine instructions, and system calls, have been implemented
   on demand.  So it's possible, although unlikely, that a program will
   fall over with a message to that effect.  If this happens, please
   report all the details printed out, so we can try and implement the
   missing feature.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Memory consumption of your program is majorly increased
   whilst running under Valgrind's Memcheck tool.  This is due to the
   large amount of administrative information maintained behind the
   scenes.  Another cause is that Valgrind dynamically translates the
   original executable.  Translated, instrumented code is 12-18 times
   larger than the original so you can easily end up with 150+ MB of
   translations when running (eg) a web browser.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Valgrind can handle dynamically-generated code just fine.  If
   you regenerate code over the top of old code (ie. at the same
   memory addresses), if the code is on the stack Valgrind will
   realise the code has changed, and work correctly.  This is
   necessary to handle the trampolines GCC uses to implemented nested
   functions.  If you regenerate code somewhere other than the stack,
   and you are running on an 32- or 64-bit x86 CPU, you will need to
   use the <option>--smc-check=all</option> option, and Valgrind will
   run more slowly than normal.  Or you can add client requests that
   tell Valgrind when your program has overwritten code.
   </para>
   <para> On other platforms (ARM, PowerPC) Valgrind observes and
   honours the cache invalidation hints that programs are obliged to
   emit to notify new code, and so self-modifying-code support should
   work automatically, without the need
   for <option>--smc-check=all</option>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Valgrind has the following limitations
   in its implementation of x86/AMD64 floating point relative to 
   IEEE754.</para>

   <para>Precision: There is no support for 80 bit arithmetic.
   Internally, Valgrind represents all such "long double" numbers in 64
   bits, and so there may be some differences in results.  Whether or
   not this is critical remains to be seen.  Note, the x86/amd64
   fldt/fstpt instructions (read/write 80-bit numbers) are correctly
   simulated, using conversions to/from 64 bits, so that in-memory
   images of 80-bit numbers look correct if anyone wants to see.</para>

   <para>The impression observed from many FP regression tests is that
   the accuracy differences aren't significant.  Generally speaking, if
   a program relies on 80-bit precision, there may be difficulties
   porting it to non x86/amd64 platforms which only support 64-bit FP
   precision.  Even on x86/amd64, the program may get different results
   depending on whether it is compiled to use SSE2 instructions (64-bits
   only), or x87 instructions (80-bit).  The net effect is to make FP
   programs behave as if they had been run on a machine with 64-bit IEEE
   floats, for example PowerPC.  On amd64 FP arithmetic is done by
   default on SSE2, so amd64 looks more like PowerPC than x86 from an FP
   perspective, and there are far fewer noticeable accuracy differences
   than with x86.</para>

   <para>Rounding: Valgrind does observe the 4 IEEE-mandated rounding
   modes (to nearest, to +infinity, to -infinity, to zero) for the
   following conversions: float to integer, integer to float where
   there is a possibility of loss of precision, and float-to-float
   rounding.  For all other FP operations, only the IEEE default mode
   (round to nearest) is supported.</para>

   <para>Numeric exceptions in FP code: IEEE754 defines five types of
   numeric exception that can happen: invalid operation (sqrt of
   negative number, etc), division by zero, overflow, underflow,
   inexact (loss of precision).</para>

   <para>For each exception, two courses of action are defined by IEEE754:
   either (1) a user-defined exception handler may be called, or (2) a
   default action is defined, which "fixes things up" and allows the
   computation to proceed without throwing an exception.</para>

   <para>Currently Valgrind only supports the default fixup actions.
   Again, feedback on the importance of exception support would be
   appreciated.</para>

   <para>When Valgrind detects that the program is trying to exceed any
   of these limitations (setting exception handlers, rounding mode, or
   precision control), it can print a message giving a traceback of
   where this has happened, and continue execution.  This behaviour used
   to be the default, but the messages are annoying and so showing them
   is now disabled by default.  Use <option>--show-emwarns=yes</option> to see
   them.</para>

   <para>The above limitations define precisely the IEEE754 'default'
   behaviour: default fixup on all exceptions, round-to-nearest
   operations, and 64-bit precision.</para>
  </listitem>
   
  <listitem>
   <para>Valgrind has the following limitations in
   its implementation of x86/AMD64 SSE2 FP arithmetic, relative to 
   IEEE754.</para>

   <para>Essentially the same: no exceptions, and limited observance of
   rounding mode.  Also, SSE2 has control bits which make it treat
   denormalised numbers as zero (DAZ) and a related action, flush
   denormals to zero (FTZ).  Both of these cause SSE2 arithmetic to be
   less accurate than IEEE requires.  Valgrind detects, ignores, and can
   warn about, attempts to enable either mode.</para>

   <para>Essentially the same: no exceptions, and limited observance
   of rounding mode.  Also, switching the VFP unit into vector mode
   will cause Valgrind to abort the program -- it has no way to
   emulate vector uses of VFP at a reasonable performance level.  This
   is no big deal given that non-scalar uses of VFP instructions are
   in any case deprecated.</para>

   <para>Valgrind has the following limitations
   in its implementation of PPC32 and PPC64 floating point 
   arithmetic, relative to IEEE754.</para>

   <para>Scalar (non-Altivec): Valgrind provides a bit-exact emulation of
   all floating point instructions, except for "fre" and "fres", which are
   done more precisely than required by the PowerPC architecture specification.
   All floating point operations observe the current rounding mode.
   </para>

   <para>However, fpscr[FPRF] is not set after each operation.  That could
   be done but would give measurable performance overheads, and so far
   no need for it has been found.</para>

   <para>As on x86/AMD64, IEEE754 exceptions are not supported: all floating
   point exceptions are handled using the default IEEE fixup actions.
   Valgrind detects, ignores, and can warn about, attempts to unmask 
   the 5 IEEE FP exception kinds by writing to the floating-point status 
   and control register (fpscr).
   </para>

   <para>Vector (Altivec, VMX): essentially as with x86/AMD64 SSE/SSE2: 
   no exceptions, and limited observance of rounding mode.  
   For Altivec, FP arithmetic
   is done in IEEE/Java mode, which is more accurate than the Linux default
   setting.  "More accurate" means that denormals are handled properly, 
   rather than simply being flushed to zero.</para>

<para>Some of these only appear if you run in verbose mode

  <listitem>
    <para><computeroutput>More than 100 errors detected.  Subsequent
    errors will still be recorded, but in less detail than
    before.</computeroutput></para>

    <para>After 100 different errors have been shown, Valgrind becomes
    more conservative about collecting them.  It then requires only the
    program counters in the top two stack frames to match when deciding
    whether or not two errors are really the same one.  Prior to this
    point, the PCs in the top four frames are required to match.  This
    hack has the effect of slowing down the appearance of new errors
    after the first 100.  The 100 constant can be changed by recompiling
    Valgrind.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><computeroutput>More than 1000 errors detected.  I'm not
    reporting any more.  Final error counts may be inaccurate.  Go fix
    your program!</computeroutput></para>

    <para>After 1000 different errors have been detected, Valgrind
    ignores any more.  It seems unlikely that collecting even more
    different ones would be of practical help to anybody, and it avoids
    the danger that Valgrind spends more and more of its time comparing
    new errors against an ever-growing collection.  As above, the 1000
    number is a compile-time constant.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><computeroutput>Warning: client switching stacks?</computeroutput></para>

    <para>Valgrind spotted such a large change in the stack pointer
    that it guesses the client is switching to a different stack.  At
    this point it makes a kludgey guess where the base of the new
    stack is, and sets memory permissions accordingly.  At the moment
    "large change" is defined as a change of more that 2000000 in the
    value of the stack pointer register.  If Valgrind guesses wrong,
    you may get many bogus error messages following this and/or have
    crashes in the stack trace recording code.  You might avoid these
    problems by informing Valgrind about the stack bounds using
    VALGRIND_STACK_REGISTER client request. </para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><computeroutput>Warning: client attempted to close Valgrind's
    logfile fd &lt;number&gt;</computeroutput></para>

    <para>Valgrind doesn't allow the client to close the logfile,
    because you'd never see any diagnostic information after that point.
    If you see this message, you may want to use the
    <option>--log-fd=&lt;number&gt;</option> option to specify a
    different logfile file-descriptor number.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><computeroutput>Warning: noted but unhandled ioctl
    &lt;number&gt;</computeroutput></para>

    <para>Valgrind observed a call to one of the vast family of
    <computeroutput>ioctl</computeroutput> system calls, but did not
    modify its memory status info (because nobody has yet written a 
    suitable wrapper).  The call will still have gone through, but you may get
    spurious errors after this as a result of the non-update of the
    memory info.</para>
