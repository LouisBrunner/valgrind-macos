Valgrind Documentation
----------------------
This text assumes the following directory structure:

Distribution text files (eg. README):
  valgrind/

Main /docs/ dir:
  valgrind/docs/

Top-level XML files: 
  valgrind/docs/xml/

Tool specific XML docs:
  valgrind/<toolname>/docs/

All images used in the docs:
  valgrind/docs/images/

Stylesheets, catalogs, parsing/formatting scripts:
  valgrind/docs/lib/

Some files of note:
  docs/xml/index.xml:       Top-level book-set wrapper
  docs/xml/FAQ.xml:         The FAQ
  docs/xml/vg-entities.xml: Various strings, dates etc. used all over
  docs/xml/xml_help.txt:    Basic guide to common XML tags.

The docs/internals directory contains some useful high-level stuff about
Valgrind's internals.  It's not relevant for the rest of this discussion.

Overview
---------
The Documentation Set contains all books, articles,
etc. pertaining to Valgrind, and is designed to be built as:
- chunked html files
- PDF file
- PS file

The whole thing is a "book set", made up of multiple books (the user
manual, the FAQ, the tech-docs, the licenses).  Each book could be
made individually, but the build system doesn't do that.

CSS: the style-sheet used by the docs is the same as that used by the
website (consistency is king).  It might be worth doing a pre-build diff
to check whether the website stylesheet has changed.


The build process
-----------------
It's not obvious exactly when things get built, and so on.  Here's an
overview:

- The HTML docs can be built manually by running 'make html-docs' in
  valgrind/docs/.  (Don't use 'make html'; that is a valid built-in
  automake target, but does nothing.)  Likewise for PDF/PS with 'make
  print-docs'.

- 'make dist' puts the XML files into the tarball.  It also builds the
  HTML docs and puts them in too, in valgrind/docs/html/ (including
  style sheets, images, etc).

- 'make install' installs the HTML docs in
  $(install)/share/doc/valgrind/html/, if they are present.  (They will
  be present if you are installing from the result of a 'make dist'.
  They might not be present if you are developing in a Subversion
  workspace and have not built them.)  It doesn't install the XML docs,
  as they're not useful installed.

If the XML processing tools ever mature enough to become standard, we
could just build the docs from XML when doing 'make install', which
would be simpler.


The XML Toolchain
------------------
I spent some time on the docbook-apps list in order to ascertain
the most-useful / widely-available / least-fragile / advanced
toolchain.  Basically, everything has problems of one sort or
another, so I ended up going with what I felt was the
least-problematical of the various options.

The maintainer is responsible for ensure the following tools are
present on his system:
- xmllint:   using libxml version 20607
- xsltproc:  using libxml 20607, libxslt 10102 and libexslt 802
             (Nb:be sure to use a version based on libxml2 
              version 2.6.11 or later.  There was a bug in 
	            xml:base processing in versions before that.)
- pdfxmltex: pdfTeX (Web2C 7.4.5) 3.14159-1.10b
- pdftops:   version 3.00
- DocBook:   version 4.2
- bzip2
- lynx

A big problem is latency.  Norman Walsh is constantly updating
DocBook, but the tools tend to lag behind somewhat.  It is
important that the versions get on with each other.  If you
decide to upgrade something, then it is your responsibility to
ascertain whether things still work nicely - this *cannot* be
assumed.

Print output: if make expires with an error, cat output.
If you see something like this:
  ! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [pool size=436070]

then look at this:
  http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2003/12/msg00020.html
and modify your texmf files accordingly.


Catalog Locations
------------------
oasis:
http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/catalog.xml
http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd

Suse 9.1: 
/usr/share/xml/docbook/ stylesheet/nwalsh/1.64.1/html/docbook.xsl
/usr/share/xml/docbook/ schema/dtd/4.2/docbookx.dtd
/usr/share/xml/docbook/ schema/dtd/4.2/catalog.xml


Notes:
------
- the end of file.xml must have only ONE newline after the last tag:
  </book>

- pdfxmltex barfs if given a filename with an underscore in it

TODO CRUCIAL:
-------------
- PS/PDF doesn't work because Latex runs out of memory
- Need to generate text FAQ from the valgrind/docs/xml/FAQ.xml (done at 'make
  dist' time along with the HTML docs using the "dist-hook"), and remove the
  old text FAQ which is in valgrind/.

TODO LESS CRUCIAL:
------------------
- add the HOWTO doc?
- writing-tools.xml refers to vg-catalog.xml but it's not in the repo... should
  it be, and if so, how should it be used?
- get rid of blank pages in fo output
- concat titlepage + subtitle page in fo output
- generate an index for the user manual (??)
- run through and check for not-linked hrefs: grep on 'http'
- run through and check for bad email addresses: grep on '@' etc.
- when we move to svn, change all refs to sourceforge.cvs
- go through and wrap refs+addresses in '<address>' tags
