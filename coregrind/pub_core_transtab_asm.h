/* Constants for the fast translation lookup cache.  It is a 4 way associative
   cache, with more-or-less LRU replacement.  It contains 2^VG_TT_FAST_BITS
   sets.

   On all targets, the set number is computed from least significant 2 *
   VG_TT_FAST_BITS of the guest address.  This is a bit unusual in as much as
   it is more normal just to use a VG_TT_FAST_BITS-sized slice of the address
   as the set number.  Using twice as many bits (the two chunks are xor'd)
   spreads entries out (reduces aliasing) and significantly reduces the overall
   miss rate.  The cost is two extra cycles on the fast lookup path, to perform
   an extra shift and an xor.

   For each set there are 4 ways: way0, way1, way2 and way3.  way0 is intended
   to be the MRU and way3 the LRU.  Most lookups hit way0 and involve no
   modification of the line.  A hit at way1 causes way0 and way1 to be swapped.
   A hit at way2 causes way1 and way2 to be swapped; that is, way2 is moved one
   step closer to the front.  But not all the way to the front.  Similarly a
   hit at way3 causes way2 and way3 to be swapped.

   See VG_(lookupInFastCache) for a C implementation of this logic and
   dispatch-*-*.S, label VG_(disp_cp_xindir), for the handcoded assembly
   equivalents for each target.  Note that VG_(lookupInFastCache) is used in C
   land for some administrative lookups but isn't really performance critical.
   The dispatch-*-*.S implementations are used to process all indirect branches
   in the simulator and so *are* performance critical.

   Updates to the cache are rare.  These are performed by setFastCacheEntry.
   New entries are put into way0 and all others are shifted down one slot, so
   that the contents of way3 falls out of the cache.

   On x86/amd64, the cache index is computed as
   (address ^ (address >>u VG_TT_FAST_BITS))[VG_TT_FAST_BITS-1 : 0]'.

   On ppc32/ppc64/mips32/mips64/arm64, the bottom two bits of instruction
   addresses are zero, which means the above function causes only 1/4 of the
   sets to ever be used.  So instead the function is
   (address ^ (address >>u VG_TT_FAST_BITS))[VG_TT_FAST_BITS-1+2 : 0+2]'.

   On arm32/s390x/riscv64, the minimum instruction size is 2, so we discard only
   the least significant bit of the address, hence:
   (address ^ (address >>u VG_TT_FAST_BITS))[VG_TT_FAST_BITS-1+1 : 0+1]'. */
