#include "pub_tool_basics.h"   // UWord

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PURPOSE: Provides a pool allocator for elements, storing only once identical
// elements. In other words, this can be considered a "dictionary" of elements.
//
// This pool allocator manages elements allocation by allocating "pools" of
// many elements from a lower level allocator (typically pub_tool_mallocfree.h).
// Single elements are allocated from these pools.
// Currently, elements can only be allocated, elements cannot be freed
// individually.
// Once allocated, an element must not be modified anymore.
//
// Elements can be inserted in the pool using VG_(allocEltDedupPA),
// VG_(allocFixedEltDedupPA) or VG_(allocStrDedupPA).
//
// Use VG_(allocFixedEltDedupPA) to allocate elements that are all of
// the same size and that you want to identify with a (small) number:
// VG_(allocFixedEltDedupPA) will assign a sequence number to each
// unique allocated element. This unique number can be translated to
// an address when the element data must be used.
// The idea is that such small numbers can be used as reference instead
// of the element address, to spare memory.
// Elements are numbered starting from 1. The nr 0 can thus be used
// as 'null element'. The address identified by a nr can change
// if new elements are inserted in the pool. Once the pool is frozen,
// an element address does not change.
//
// Use VG_(allocEltDedupPA) for variable size elements or when the
// memory needed to store the element reference is not critical or
// when performance to access elements is critical.
// The address of an element allocated with VG_(allocEltDedupPA) does
// not change, even if new elements are inserted in the pool.
//
// Use VG_(allocStrDedupPA) to create a pool of strings (in other words, a
//  dictionnary of strings). Similarly to VG_(allocFixedEltDedupPA), strings
// inserted in a dedup pool can be identified by an element number.
//
// In the same pool, you can only use one of the allocate element functions.
// 
// A dedup pool allocator has significantly less memory overhead than
// calling directly pub_tool_mallocfree.h if the deduplication factor
// is big. However, allocating an element incurs a cost for searching
// if an identical element is already in the pool.
//
// Note: the elements of the pool cannot be freed (at least currently).
// The only way to free the elements is to delete the dedup pool allocator.
