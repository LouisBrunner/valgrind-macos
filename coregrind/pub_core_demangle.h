   Z-encoded names are used by Valgrind for doing function 
   interception/wrapping.

   Demangle 'sym' into its soname and fnname parts, putting them in
   the specified buffers.  Returns a Bool indicating whether the
   demangled failed or not.  A failure can occur because the prefix
   isn't recognised, the internal Z-escaping is wrong, or because one
   or the other (or both) of the output buffers becomes full.  Passing
   'so' as NULL is acceptable if the caller is only interested in the
   function name part. */
