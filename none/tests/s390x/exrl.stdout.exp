------- Copy 10+1 bytes from buffer to target
------- EXRL to OR in the length
before: buffer = |0123456789abcdef|
before: target = |XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|
after:  buffer = |0123456789abcdef|
after:  target = |0123456789aXXXXX|

------- EXRL 0,... has no effect (writes out target)
        target = |0123456789aXXXXX|

------- EXRL to OR in the syscall number (writes out target)
        target = |0123456789aXXXXX|

------- EXRL with negative offset
        target = |01010101010XXXXX|

------- EXRL targeting a PC-relative instruction
        offset = |0000000000000004|

------- EXRL targeting a branch-and-link instruction
        offset = |000000000000000a|
