/* IMPORTANT COMMENT about memory persistence and ownership.

   Many functions below are returning a string in a HChar** argument.
   This memory must not be freed by the caller : it belongs to the debuginfo
   module. The returned string is *not* guaranteed to be persistent.
   The exact persistence depends on the kind of information returned,
   and of the internal implementation of the debuginfo module.
   In other words: use the memory directly after the call, and if in doubt,
   save it away.

   In general, all returned strings will be invalidated when the
   DebugInfo they correspond to is discarded. This is the case for
   the filename, dirname, fnname and objname.
   An objname might also be invalidated by changes to the address
   space manager segments, e.g. if a segment is merged with another
   segment.

   Retrieving a fnname might imply a call to the c++ demangler.
   A returned fnname is invalidated if any other call to the demangler
   is done. In particular, this means that the memory returned by one of
   the VG_(get_fnname...) functions is invalidated by :
     * another call to any of the functions VG_(get_fnname...).
     * any other call that will directly or indirectly invoke the
       c++ demangler. Such an indirect call to the demangler can a.o. be
       done by calls to pub_tool_errormgr.h functions.
   So, among others, the following is WRONG:
       VG_(get_fnname)(a1, &fnname1);
       VG_(get_fnname)(a2, &fnname2);
       ... it is WRONG to use fnname1 here ....
