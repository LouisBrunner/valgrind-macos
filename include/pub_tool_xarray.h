// PURPOSE: Provides a simple but useful structure, which is an array
// in which elements can be added at the end.  The array is expanded
// as needed by multiplying its size by a constant factor (usually 2).
// This gives amortised O(1) insertion cost, and, following sorting,
// the usual O(log N) binary search cost.  Arbitrary element sizes
// are allowed; the comparison function for sort/lookup can be changed
// at any time, and duplicates (modulo the comparison function) are
// allowed.
