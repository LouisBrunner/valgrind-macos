//--------------------------------------------------------------------
// PURPOSE: Provides an implementation of a sparse array of host words
// (UWord).  The indices are themselves host words.  The implementation
// uses a 256-way radix tree, which is therefore 4 levels deep on a 
// 32-bit platform and 8 levels deep on a 64-bit platform.
//--------------------------------------------------------------------

// No core-only exports; everything in this module is visible to both
// the core and tools.
