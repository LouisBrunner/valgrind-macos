Greetings, packaging person!  This information is aimed at people
building binary distributions of Valgrind.

Thanks for taking the time and effort to make a binary distribution
of Valgrind.  The following notes may save you some trouble.


-- (Unfortunate but true) When you configure to build with the 
   --prefix=/foo/bar/xyzzy option, the prefix /foo/bar/xyzzy gets
   baked into valgrind.  The consequence is that you _must_ install
   valgrind at the location specified in the prefix.  If you don't,
   it may appear to work, but will break doing some obscure things,
   particularly doing fork() and exec().

   So you can't build a relocatable RPM / whatever from Valgrind.


-- Don't strip the debug info off stage2 or libpthread.so.
   Valgrind will still work if you do, but it will generate less
   helpful error messages.  Here's an example:

   Mismatched free() / delete / delete []
      at 0x40043249: free (vg_clientfuncs.c:171)
      by 0x4102BB4E: QGArray::~QGArray(void) (tools/qgarray.cpp:149)
      by 0x4C261C41: PptDoc::~PptDoc(void) (include/qmemarray.h:60)
      by 0x4C261F0E: PptXml::~PptXml(void) (pptxml.cc:44)
      Address 0x4BB292A8 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 64 alloc'd
      at 0x4004318C: __builtin_vec_new (vg_clientfuncs.c:152)
      by 0x4C21BC15: KLaola::readSBStream(int) const (klaola.cc:314)
      by 0x4C21C155: KLaola::stream(KLaola::OLENode const *) (klaola.cc:416)
      by 0x4C21788F: OLEFilter::convert(QCString const &) (olefilter.cc:272)

   This tells you that some memory allocated with new[] was freed with
   free().  If stage2 was stripped the message would look like this:

   Mismatched free() / delete / delete []
      at 0x40043249: (inside stage2)
      by 0x4102BB4E: QGArray::~QGArray(void) (tools/qgarray.cpp:149)
      by 0x4C261C41: PptDoc::~PptDoc(void) (include/qmemarray.h:60)
      by 0x4C261F0E: PptXml::~PptXml(void) (pptxml.cc:44)
      Address 0x4BB292A8 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 64 alloc'd
      at 0x4004318C: (inside stage2)
      by 0x4C21BC15: KLaola::readSBStream(int) const (klaola.cc:314)
      by 0x4C21C155: KLaola::stream(KLaola::OLENode const *) (klaola.cc:416)
      by 0x4C21788F: OLEFilter::convert(QCString const &) (olefilter.cc:272)

   This isn't so helpful.  Although you can tell there is a mismatch, 
   the names of the allocating and deallocating functions are no longer
   visible.  The same kind of thing occurs in various other messages 
   from valgrind.


-- Please test the final installation works by running it on
   something huge.  I suggest checking that it can start and
   exit successfully both Mozilla-1.0 and OpenOffice.org 1.0.
   I use these as test programs, and I know they fairly thoroughly
   exercise Valgrind.  The command lines to use are:

   valgrind -v --trace-children=yes --workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes mozilla

   valgrind -v --trace-children=yes --workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes soffice


If you find any more hints/tips for packaging, please report
it as a bugreport. See http://valgrind.kde.org/bugs.html for details.
