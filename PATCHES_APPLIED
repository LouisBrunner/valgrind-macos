I decided it would be clearest for everybody (including me!) if I make
a record of patches that I apply.  The starting point for all these is
valgrind-20020214; patches applied to it before that snapshot was
released are not recorded anywhere.


------------------------------ 14 Feb 02 ------------------------------

Michael Matz <matz@kde.org>:
   this fixes the leak (32bytes/demangled symbol)in cplus-dem.c.  It also
   again localizes the changes to libiberty's cp-demangle.c at the top with
   some #defines.  (It also has some unrelated changes like header guarding
   and making symbol sets disjoint, these are minor and were needed for the
   demangle_test program, and are local to the demangler)

   JRS: applied it, but it still seems to leak, running a g++2.96 compiled
   program, at least (/usr/bin/kedit as installed with RH72).
   (reenable VG_(show_all_arena_stats)() at vg_demangle.c:63 to see this)


Michael Matz <matz@kde.org>
   here the patch for changing order of restorage of %esp to not trash
   simulees stack


Simon Hausmann <hausmann@kde.org>
   I attached a patch for the latest vg snapshot to implement better
   support for shmat. Vg now correct marks the region returned by shmat
   as read or read-writable (we have to do that blindly as there is no
   way to figure out if another process initialized the data or not) .
   Also the patch adds a paranoia check for the buffer passed with
   shmctl. What's left todo is to make shmdt correctly mark the shm
   segment as invalid again, but I see no easy way to figure out the
   shm segment size just from the base address. Anyone? :)
   Otherwise it'll probably require keeping a copy of the allocated
   mappings inside vg -- shouldn't be expensive though. 
   [...]
   Oops, my previous shm patch contained a little bug in that it called
   must_be_readable/writable for shmctl even when the address was 0
   (which for example is the case when using IPC_RMID to remove a
   shared memory segment, which is perfectly valid) . Attached the
   updated patch that makes valgrinding Qt/Embedded apps possible :)


me:
   Check for accessibility changes for first and last 64k of address
   space after every system call, so as to catch syscall wrapper
   bugs as soon as they happen


Simon Hausmann <hausmann@kde.org>
   The socketpair handler checks that the two fds passed must be
   readable, but I think the check should use must_be_writable instead
   as the kernel does not read those values but fills them in.


Simon Hausmann <hausmann@kde.org>
   Here's a patch that implements checking of arguments for
   sendmsg/recvmsg, as part of the socket syscall.
   [...]
   Oops, I just realized that the recvmsg wrapper should mark the
   fields of the received message as readable, as the kernel hopefully
   initialized them :)
   [...]
   Corrected patch attached.


Nick Nethercote <njn25@cam.ac.uk>
   [Implemented pushaw/pushal/popaw/popal]

   They're kind of ugly due to the special treatment of %esp, but there
   didn't seem to be any elegant way around it.  You may object to my
   heinous magic number use with the registers.
   
   It seems to work ok, but I'd check it carefully if I were you.  In
   particular, I've only tried it with POPAD. (I think;  gcc only accepts
   'popa' in assembler files, and according to the Intel docs will probably
   choose between POPA and POPAD by looking at the D flag of the current
   code segment's descriptor.  I'm guessing this is 32-bits for my little 
   test program.)


Dirk Mueller <mueller@kde.org>
   below a patch for checking if allocations are done correctly in C++ 
   applications. it checks if new is free'ed by delete, new [] by delete [],
   and malloc, calloc, realloc by free(). 

   It works for me <tm>, not intensively tested yet.

   I.e. I would find the attached patch more usefull, which introduces an
   --bt-size=<num> option (with docu ;-) ) but removes that long=yes/no
   option.

   JRS: the final name for the option is --num-callers


------------------------------ 15 Feb 02 ------------------------------

me:
   fix assertion failure in VG_(malloc_aligned) (duh. duh. duh.)


Michael Matz <matzmich@cs.tu-berlin.de>
   [finally fix the last space leak in the demangler]
   this should now fix the rest of the leaks.  The old c++ demangler is
   really crappy code, therefor it took longer to find the leaks.  ;)


Simon Hausmann <hausmann@kde.org>
   Here are two micro patches for vg :)

   The first one fixes what I think is a bug: I think the result param
   of llseek before the actual syscall should be checked for
   writability instead of readability.

   The second one is a quick workaround for an assertion in the
   demangler that I hit quite sometimes (I'm surprised noone else has
   hit it before, maybe it's gcc3 specific though :) . I'm too lazy to 
   write a full strtol replacement for now ;) , so just returning an
   error will keep the program running and output the mangled symbol
   instead.


------------------------------ 17 Feb 02 ------------------------------

me:
   Implement cleverer semantics for 4-byte integer loads from partially
   valid addresses, following complains from Coolo re spurious warnings
   from gcc-inlined strlen()s.  As part of this, hardwire the default
   behaviour of --bad-addr-value and get rid of this flag entirely.
   New flag --partial-loads-ok=no|yes [default yes] controls use of
   new semantics.  Also as a result, stop recommending people use
   --sloppy-malloc=yes by default.

me:
   Options are now read from env var VALGRIND_OPTS.
   Also remove need to edit hardware install dir in shell script.


Michael Matz <matzmich@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Simon Hausmann <hausmann@kde.org>
   this fixes some leaks in the v3 demangler found by Simon (Julian: i.e.
   those we couldn't possibly run into, as we use v2 demangling).


------------------------------ 18 Feb 02 ------------------------------

me:
   Tighten up the conditions for which --partial-loads-ok=yes is allowed

me:
   Error management: slow down collecting errors after the 50th
   and stop altogether after the 500th

me:
   Implement --workaround-gcc296-bugs, so RH 7.X and Mandrake users
   can use their default compilers.


------------------------------ 20 Feb 02 ------------------------------

me:
   Massive overhaul of the signal machinery so that signals can be
   delivered to the client even when it is blocked in a system call.
   This fixes the kmail-deadlocks-on-valgrind problem.

------------------------------ 21 Feb 02 ------------------------------

me:
   Implement GDB attachment to the program.  

Stephan Kulow <coolo@kde.org>
   Implement a few more syscall wrappers

------------------------------ 24 Feb 02 ------------------------------

me:
   Cleanup of the signal machinery.  Now we deal with signals purely
   at the kernel interface, rather than muddying glibc's and the kernel's
   conflicting concepts of some of the calls and structures.

Kevin Dwyer <kevin@pheared.net>
   Implement bazillions of syscall wrappers for ioctls

me:
   minor cleanups in vg_memory.c

------------------------------ 4 Mar 02 -------------------------------

This file is falling significantly behind reality.

Me: get rid of this pointless and incorrect assert:
   vg_memory.c:441 (set_address_range_perms): Assertion `len < 30000000' failed.

Me: remove incorrect assert:
   vg_assert(u_in->flags_w != FlagsEmpty);

   useful.

------------------------------ 8 Mar 02 -------------------------------

Me
   Split up huge basic blocks into pieces, to avoid this:

Me
   Fix obscure simulated CPU bug causing this:
   -1: CMOVW     t34, t36  (-rOSZACP)
   valgrind: vg_to_ucode.c:4197 (disInstr): Assertion `sane' failed.
   (Spotted by Thorsten Schnebeck <thorsten.schnebeck@gmx.net>)

Me
   Add yet more suppressions to linux24.supp

Me [subrev b only]
   In the leak checker, use __builtin_{setjmp,longjmp} instead of the
   glibc (pthread) versions.  This avoids a subtle memory corruption
   problem caused by pthread_longjmp (or whatever it is called), which
   finally manifests itself in this assertion failure:
      vgPlain_primary_map[i] == & vg_distinguished_secondary_map
   Many thanks to Michael Matz for coming up with an easy solution
   which saved me hours of pissing around.

----------------------------- 15 Mar 02 second snapshot (0315b) -------

Me
   Allow suppression of invalid free  and  mismatching free errors.

   Resurrect the internal profiling stuff (VG_PROFILE) and then fail
   to find anything obvious that I could speed up :-(

   Start playing with using AMD cache prefetch insns as described
   in docs/techdocs.html.

   Wrap ioctl SNDCTL_DSP_GETSPDIF in #ifdef; apparently undefined in
