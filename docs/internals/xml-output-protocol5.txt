Protocol 5 is identical to protocol 4 but adds core-error elements for
tool agnostic output. Currently only set when using the --track-fds
option (otherwise the protocolversion is set to 4).

====================================================================

core-errors can appear where TOOLSPECIFIC definitions can occur.  This
is always an ERROR which follows the generic ERROR definition with the
following extra details.

ERROR details for file-tracking core errors
-------------------------------------------

The KIND is a new unique string described below.
There can be an fd and (option) PATH element.

* <fd>INT</fd>, file descriptor number associated with error.

* <path>TEXT</path>, (optional) file path associated with fd (if known).

KIND for file-tracking core errors
----------------------------------

This is a small enumeration indicating roughly the nature of an error.
The possible values are:

   FdBadClose

      The file descriptor was already closed previously

   FdNotClosed

      On exit the file descriptor is still open
