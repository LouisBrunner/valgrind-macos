# Below is a temporary patch (slightly modified) from
#   345307 - Warning about "still reachable" memory when using libstdc++ from gcc 5
# This patch is not needed anymore if libstdc++ provides __gnu_cxx::__freeres
# but we still need to ignore these allocations during the leak_cpp_interior
# to have the test behaviour not depending on libstdc++ version.



# Some programs are using the C++ STL and string classes.
# Valgrind reports 'still reachable' memory leaks involving these classes
# at the exit of the program, but there should be none.
#
# Many implementations of the C++ standard libraries use their own memory
# pool allocators.  Memory for quite a number of destructed objects is not
# immediately freed and given back to the OS, but kept in the pool(s) for
# later re-use.  The fact that the pools are not freed at the exit of the
# program cause Valgrind to report this memory as still reachable.
#
# The behavior not to free pools at the exit could be called a bug of the
# library though.
#
# Using GCC, you can force the STL to use malloc and to free memory as soon
# as possible by globally disabling memory caching.  Beware! Doing so will
# probably slow down your program, sometimes drastically.
#
# There are other ways to disable memory pooling: using the malloc_alloc
# template with your objects (not portable, but should work for GCC) or
# even writing your own memory allocators.   But beware: allocators belong
# to the more messy parts of the STL and people went to great lengths to
# make the STL portable across platforms.  Chances are good that your
# solution will work on your platform, but not on others.
