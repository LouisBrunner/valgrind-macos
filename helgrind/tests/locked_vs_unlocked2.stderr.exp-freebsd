Possible data race during write of size 4 at 0x........ by thread #x
Locks held: 2, at addresses 0x........ 0x........
   at 0x........: child_fn2 (locked_vs_unlocked2.c:44)
   by 0x........: mythread_wrapper (hg_intercepts.c:...)
   ...

This conflicts with a previous write of size 4 by thread #x
Locks held: 2, at address 0x........ (and 1 that can't be shown)
   at 0x........: child_fn1 (locked_vs_unlocked2.c:28)
   by 0x........: mythread_wrapper (hg_intercepts.c:...)
   ...
 Address 0x........ is 0 bytes inside data symbol "x"
