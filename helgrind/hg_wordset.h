   BUG ALERT: !!! Using HG_(dieWS) on a WSU introduces a risk of
   dangling references.  Dangling references can be created by keeping
   a ws after having marked it dead. This ws (just an index in
   reality) will be re-cycled : a newly created wv can get the same
   index. This implies that the wrong wv will be used if the 
   "old" ws has been kept.
   Re-using a "dead" ws will be detected if the index has not been
   re-cycled yet.

   Another possibility of bug is to ask for the payload of a ws, and
   then have this ws marked dead while the payload is still being
   examined. This is a real dangling reference in free or re-allocated
   memory. */
