         At the end of each translation, the next guest address is
         placed in the host's standard return register (x86: %eax,

         special action required before the next block is run.

         Control is then passed back to the dispatcher (beyond Vex's
         control; caller supplies this) in the following way:

         - On host archs which lack a link register (x86, amd64), by a
           jump to the host address specified in
           'dispatcher_assisted', if the guest state pointer has been
           changed so as to request some action before the next block
           is run, or 'dispatcher_unassisted' (the fast path), in
           which it is assumed that the guest state pointer is
           unchanged and we wish to continue directly with the next
           translation.  Both of these must be non-NULL.

         - On host archs which have a link register (ppc32, ppc64), by
           a branch to the link register (which is guaranteed to be
           unchanged from whatever it was at entry to the
           translation).  'dispatch_assisted' and
           'dispatch_unassisted' must be NULL.

         The aim is to get back and forth between translations and the
         dispatcher without creating memory traffic to store return
         addresses.

/* Code generation conventions that need to be recorded somewhere.
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   x86
   ~~~
   Generated code should be entered using a JMP instruction.  On
   entry, %ebp should point to the guest state, and %esp should be a
   valid stack pointer.  The generated code may change %eax, %ebx,
   %ecx, %edx, %esi, %edi, all the FP registers and control state, and
   all the XMM registers.

   On entry, the FPU control word should be set to 0x027F, and the SSE
   control word (%mxcsr) should be set to 0x1F80.  On exit, they
   should still have those values (after masking off the lowest 6 bits
   of %mxcsr).  If they don't, there is a bug in VEX-generated code.

   Generated code returns to the scheduler using a JMP instruction, to
   the address specified in the .dispatch field of VexTranslateArgs.
   %eax (or %eax:%edx, if simulating a 64-bit target) will contain the
   guest address of the next block to execute.  %ebp may be changed
   to a VEX_TRC_ value, otherwise it should be as it was at entry.

   CRITICAL ISSUES in x86 code generation.  The only known critical
   issue is that the host FPU and SSE state is not properly saved
   across calls to helper functions.  If any helper references any
   such state, it is likely (1) to misbehave itself, since the FP
   stack tags will not be as expected, and (2) after returning to
   generated code, the generated code is likely to go wrong.  This
   really should be fixed.

   amd64
   ~~~~~
   Analogous to x86.

   ppc32
   ~~~~~
   On entry, guest state pointer is r31.  .dispatch must be NULL.
   Control is returned with a branch to the link register.  Generated
   code will not change lr.  At return, r3 holds the next guest addr
   (or r3:r4 ?).  r31 may be may be changed to a VEX_TRC_ value,
   otherwise it should be as it was at entry.

   ppc64
   ~~~~~
   Same as ppc32.

   arm32
   ~~~~~
   r8 is GSP.

   arm64
   ~~~~~
   r21 is GSP.

   ALL GUEST ARCHITECTURES
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The guest state must contain two pseudo-registers, guest_CMSTART
   and guest_CMLEN.  These are used to specify guest address ranges,
   either of code to be invalidated, when used in conjunction with
   Ijk_InvalICache, or of d-cache ranges to be flushed, when used in
   conjunction with Ijk_FlushDCache.  In such cases, the two _CM
   pseudo-regs should be filled in by the IR, and then an exit with
   one of the two abovementioned Ijk_ kinds should happen, so that the
   dispatcher can action them.  Both pseudo-regs must have size equal
   to the guest word size.

   The architecture must a third pseudo-register, guest_NRADDR, also
   guest-word-sized.  This is used to record the unredirected guest
   address at the start of a translation whose start has been
   redirected.  By reading this pseudo-register shortly afterwards,
   the translation can find out what the corresponding no-redirection
   address was.  Note, this is only set for wrap-style redirects, not
   for replace-style ones.
