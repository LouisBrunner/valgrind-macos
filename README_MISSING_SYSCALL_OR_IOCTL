Dealing with missing system call or ioctl wrappers in Valgrind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're probably reading this because Valgrind bombed out whilst
running your program, and advised you to read this file.  The good
news is that, in general, it's easy to write the missing syscall or
ioctl wrappers you need, so that you can continue your debugging.  If
you send the resulting patches to me, then you'll be doing a favour to
all future Valgrind users too.

Note that an "ioctl" is just a special kind of system call, really; so
there's not a lot of need to distinguish them (at least conceptually)
in the discussion that follows.

All this machinery is in coregrind/vg_syscalls.c.


What are syscall/ioctl wrappers?  What do they do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valgrind does what it does, in part, by keeping track of everything your
program does.  When a system call happens, for example a request to read
part of a file, control passes to the Linux kernel, which fulfills the
request, and returns control to your program.  The problem is that the
kernel will often change the status of some part of your program's memory
as a result, and skins (instrumentation plug-ins) may need to know about
this.

Syscall and ioctl wrappers have two jobs: 

1. Tell a skin what's about to happen, before the syscall takes place.  A
   skin could perform checks beforehand, eg. if memory about to be written
   is actually writeable.  This part is useful, but not strictly
   essential.

2. Tell a skin what just happened, after a syscall takes place.  This is
   so it can update its view of the program's state, eg. that memory has
   just been written to.  This step is essential.

The "happenings" mostly involve reading/writing of memory.

So, let's look at an example of a wrapper for a system call which
should be familiar to many Unix programmers.


The syscall wrapper for time()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Removing the debug printing clutter, it looks like this:

  case __NR_time: /* syscall 13 */
     /* time_t time(time_t *t); */
     if (arg1 != (UInt)NULL) {
        SYSCALL_TRACK( pre_mem_write, tst, "time", arg1, sizeof(time_t) );
     }
     KERNEL_DO_SYSCALL(tid,res);
     if (!VG_(is_kerror)(res) && arg1 != (UInt)NULL) {
        VG_TRACK( post_mem_write, arg1, sizeof(time_t) );
     }
     break;

The first thing we do is, if a non-NULL buffer is passed in as the argument,
tell the skin that the buffer is about to be written to:

     if (arg1 != (UInt)NULL) {
        SYSCALL_TRACK( pre_mem_write, tst, "time", arg1, sizeof(time_t) );
     }

Now Valgrind asks the kernel to actally do the system call, for the thread
identified by thread ID "tid", depositing the return value in "res":

     KERNEL_DO_SYSCALL(tid, res);

Finally, the really important bit.  If, and only if, the system call
was successful, tell the skin that the memory was written:

     if (!VG_(is_kerror)(res) && arg1 != (UInt)NULL) {
        VG_TRACK( post_mem_write, arg1, sizeof(time_t) );
     }

The function VG_(is_kerror) tells you whether or not its argument
represents a Linux kernel return error code.  Hence the test.


Writing your own syscall wrappers (see below for ioctl wrappers)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If Valgrind tells you that system call NNN is unimplemented, do the 
following:

1.  Find out the name of the system call:

       grep NNN /usr/include/asm/unistd.h

    This should tell you something like  __NR_mysyscallname.


2.  Do 'man 2 mysyscallname' to get some idea of what the syscall
    does.


3.  Add a case to the already-huge collection of wrappers in 
    vg_syscall_mem.c.  For each in-memory parameter which is read or
    written by the syscall, do one of
    
      SYSCALL_TRACK( pre_mem_read, ... )
      SYSCALL_TRACK( pre_mem_read_asciiz, ... ) 
      SYSCALL_TRACK( pre_mem_write, ... ) 
      
    for  that parameter.  Then do the syscall.  Then, if the syscall
    succeeds, issue suitable VG_TRACK( post_mem_write, ... ) calls.
    (There's no need for post_mem_read calls.)
    
    If you find this difficult, read the wrappers for other syscalls
    for ideas.  A good tip is to look for the wrapper for a syscall
    which has a similar behaviour to yours, and use it as a 
    starting point.

    If you have to #include headers for structure definitions,
    put your #includes into vg_unsafe.h.

    Test it.

    Note that a common error is to call VG_TRACK( post_mem_write, ... )
    with 0 (NULL) as the first (address) argument.  This usually means
    your logic is slightly inadequate.  It's a sufficiently common bug
    that there's a built-in check for it, and you'll get a "probably
    sanity check failure" for the syscall wrapper you just made, if this
    is the case.

    Note that many syscalls are bracketed by #if defined(__NR_mysyscall)
    ... #endif, because they exist only in the 2.4 kernel and not
    the 2.2 kernel.  This enables the same piece of code to serve both
    kernels.  Please try and stick to this convention.


4.  Once happy, send me the patch.  Pretty please.




Writing your own ioctl wrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is pretty much the same as writing syscall wrappers.

There's a default case, sometimes it isn't correct and you have to write a
more specific case to get the right behaviour.

As above, please do send me the resulting patch.
