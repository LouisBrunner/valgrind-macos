Release 3.10.0 (?? ?????? 201?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.10.0 is not yet released.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Support for Android on MIPS32.
* Support for 64bit FPU on MIPS32 platforms.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================

* Memcheck:
  - new client requests 
    VALGRIND_DISABLE_ADDR_ERROR_REPORTING_IN_RANGE and
    VALGRIND_ENABLE_ADDR_ERROR_REPORTING_IN_RANGE

* Helgrind:
  - Helgrind GDB server monitor command 'info locks' giving
    the list of locks, their location, and their status.

* Callgrind:
  - callgrind_control now supports the --vgdb-prefix argument,
    which is needed if valgrind was started with this same argument.

* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================

* New and modified GDB server monitor features:

  - The GDB server monitor command 'v.info location <address>'
    outputs information about an address. The information produced depends
    on the tool and on the options given to valgrind.
    Possibly, the following are described: global variables, local (stack)
    variables, allocated or freed blocks, ...

  - The option "--vgdb-stop-at=event1,event2,..." allows the user
    to ask GDB server to stop before program execution, at the end
    of the program execution and on Valgrind internal errors.

  - A new monitor command "v.info stats" that shows various valgrind core and
    tool statistics.

  - A new monitor command "v.set hostvisibility" that allows GDB server
    to provide access to Valgrind internal host status/memory.

* New option --aspace-minaddr=<address> allows to (possibly) make
  use of some more memory by decreasing the default value above which
  Valgrind maps memory or solve some conflicts with system libraries
  by increasing the value.
  See user manual for details.
 
* Minor improvements in dwarf handling with --read-var-info=yes
  - Ada and C struct containing VLA do not cause a bad DIE error anymore
  - Code compiled with -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wl,--gc-sections
    does not cause assert errors anymore.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that
are not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.9.0 (31 October 2013)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.9.0 is a feature release with many improvements and the usual
collection of bug fixes.

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,
PPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux, MIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android,
X86/Android, X86/MacOSX 10.7 and AMD64/MacOSX 10.7.  Support for
MacOSX 10.8 is significantly improved relative to the 3.8.0 release.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Support for MIPS64 LE and BE running Linux.  Valgrind has been
  tested on MIPS64 Debian Squeeze and Debian Wheezy distributions.

* Support for MIPS DSP ASE on MIPS32 platforms.

* Support for s390x Decimal Floating Point instructions on hosts that
  have the DFP facility installed.

* Support for POWER8 (Power ISA 2.07) instructions

* Support for Intel AVX2 instructions.  This is available only on 64
  bit code.

* Initial support for Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions,
  both RTM and HLE.

* Initial support for Hardware Transactional Memory on POWER.

* Improved support for MacOSX 10.8 (64-bit only).  Memcheck can now
  run large GUI apps tolerably well.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================

* Memcheck:

  - Improvements in handling of vectorised code, leading to
    significantly fewer false error reports.  You need to use the flag
    --partial-loads-ok=yes to get the benefits of these changes.

  - Better control over the leak checker.  It is now possible to
    specify which leak kinds (definite/indirect/possible/reachable)
    should be displayed, which should be regarded as errors, and which
    should be suppressed by a given leak suppression.  This is done
    using the options --show-leak-kinds=kind1,kind2,..,
    --errors-for-leak-kinds=kind1,kind2,.. and an optional
    "match-leak-kinds:" line in suppression entries, respectively.

    Note that generated leak suppressions contain this new line and
    are therefore more specific than in previous releases.  To get the
    same behaviour as previous releases, remove the "match-leak-kinds:"
    line from generated suppressions before using them.

  - Reduced "possible leak" reports from the leak checker by the use
    of better heuristics.  The available heuristics provide detection
    of valid interior pointers to std::stdstring, to new[] allocated
    arrays with elements having destructors and to interior pointers
    pointing to an inner part of a C++ object using multiple
    inheritance.  They can be selected individually using the
    option --leak-check-heuristics=heur1,heur2,...

  - Better control of stacktrace acquisition for heap-allocated
    blocks.  Using the --keep-stacktraces option, it is possible to
    control independently whether a stack trace is acquired for each
    allocation and deallocation.  This can be used to create better
    "use after free" errors or to decrease Valgrind's resource
    consumption by recording less information.

  - Better reporting of leak suppression usage.  The list of used
    suppressions (shown when the -v option is given) now shows, for
    each leak suppressions, how many blocks and bytes it suppressed
    during the last leak search.

* Helgrind:

  - False errors resulting from the use of statically initialised
    mutexes and condition variables (PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALISER, etc)
    have been removed.

  - False errors resulting from the use of pthread_cond_waits that
    timeout, have been removed.

* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================

* Some attempt to tune Valgrind's space requirements to the expected
  capabilities of the target:

  - The default size of the translation cache has been reduced from 8
    sectors to 6 on Android platforms, since each sector occupies
    about 40MB when using Memcheck.

  - The default size of the translation cache has been increased to 16
    sectors on all other platforms, reflecting the fact that large
    applications require instrumentation and storage of huge amounts
    of code.  For similar reasons, the number of memory mapped
    segments that can be tracked has been increased by a factor of 6.

  - In all cases, the maximum number of sectors in the translation
    cache can be controlled by the new flag --num-transtab-sectors.

* Changes in how debug info (line numbers, etc) is read:

  - Valgrind no longer temporarily mmaps the entire object to read
    from it.  Instead, reading is done through a small fixed sized
    buffer.  This avoids virtual memory usage spikes when Valgrind
    reads debuginfo from large shared objects.

  - A new experimental remote debug info server.  Valgrind can read
    debug info from a different machine (typically, a build host)
    where debuginfo objects are stored.  This can save a lot of time
    and hassle when running Valgrind on resource-constrained targets
    (phones, tablets) when the full debuginfo objects are stored
    somewhere else.  This is enabled by the --debuginfo-server=
    option.

  - Consistency checking between main and debug objects can be
    disabled using the --allow-mismatched-debuginfo option.

* Stack unwinding by stack scanning, on ARM.  Unwinding by stack
  scanning can recover stack traces in some cases when the normal
  unwind mechanisms fail.  Stack scanning is best described as "a
  nasty, dangerous and misleading hack" and so is disabled by default.
  Use --unw-stack-scan-thresh and --unw-stack-scan-frames to enable
  and control it.

* Detection and merging of recursive stack frame cycles.  When your
  program has recursive algorithms, this limits the memory used by
  Valgrind for recorded stack traces and avoids recording
  uninteresting repeated calls.  This is controlled by the command
  line option --merge-recursive-frame and by the monitor command
  "v.set merge-recursive-frames".

* File name and line numbers for used suppressions.  The list of used
  suppressions (shown when the -v option is given) now shows, for each
  used suppression, the file name and line number where the suppression
  is defined.

* New and modified GDB server monitor features:

  - valgrind.h has a new client request, VALGRIND_MONITOR_COMMAND,
    that can be used to execute gdbserver monitor commands from the
    client program.

  - A new monitor command, "v.info open_fds", that gives the list of
    open file descriptors and additional details.

  - An optional message in the "v.info n_errs_found" monitor command,
    for example "v.info n_errs_found test 1234 finished", allowing a
    comment string to be added to the process output, perhaps for the
    purpose of separating errors of different tests or test phases.

  - A new monitor command "v.info execontext" that shows information
    about the stack traces recorded by Valgrind.

  - A new monitor command "v.do expensive_sanity_check_general" to run
    some internal consistency checks.

* New flag --sigill-diagnostics to control whether a diagnostic
  message is printed when the JIT encounters an instruction it can't
  translate.  The actual behavior -- delivery of SIGILL to the
  application -- is unchanged.

* The maximum amount of memory that Valgrind can use on 64 bit targets
  has been increased from 32GB to 64GB.  This should make it possible
  to run applications on Memcheck that natively require up to about 35GB.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

Release 3.8.1 (19 September 2012)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.8.1 is a bug fix release.  It fixes some assertion failures in 3.8.0
that occur moderately frequently in real use cases, adds support for
some missing instructions on ARM, and fixes a deadlock condition on
MacOSX.  If you package or deliver 3.8.0 for others to use, you might
want to consider upgrading to 3.8.1 instead.

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that
are not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.8.0 (10 August 2012)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.8.0 is a feature release with many improvements and the usual
collection of bug fixes.

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,
PPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS/Linux, ARM/Android, X86/Android,
X86/MacOSX 10.6/10.7 and AMD64/MacOSX 10.6/10.7.  Support for recent
distros and toolchain components (glibc 2.16, gcc 4.7) has been added.
There is initial support for MacOSX 10.8, but it is not usable for
serious work at present.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Support for MIPS32 platforms running Linux.  Valgrind has been
  tested on MIPS32 and MIPS32r2 platforms running different Debian
  Squeeze and MeeGo distributions.  Both little-endian and big-endian
  cores are supported.  The tools Memcheck, Massif and Lackey have
  been tested and are known to work. See README.mips for more details.

* Preliminary support for Android running on x86.

* Preliminary (as-yet largely unusable) support for MacOSX 10.8.

* Support for Intel AVX instructions and for AES instructions.  This
  support is available only for 64 bit code.

* Support for POWER Decimal Floating Point instructions.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================

* Non-libc malloc implementations are now supported.  This is useful
  for tools that replace malloc (Memcheck, Massif, DRD, Helgrind).
  Using the new option --soname-synonyms, such tools can be informed
  that the malloc implementation is either linked statically into the
  executable, or is present in some other shared library different
  from libc.so.  This makes it possible to process statically linked
  programs, and programs using other malloc libraries, for example
  TCMalloc or JEMalloc.

* For tools that provide their own replacement for malloc et al, the
  option --redzone-size=<number> allows users to specify the size of
  the padding blocks (redzones) added before and after each client
  allocated block.  Smaller redzones decrease the memory needed by
  Valgrind.  Bigger redzones increase the chance to detect blocks
  overrun or underrun.  Prior to this change, the redzone size was
  hardwired to 16 bytes in Memcheck.

* Memcheck:

  - The leak_check GDB server monitor command now can
    control the maximum nr of loss records to output.

  - Reduction of memory use for applications allocating
    many blocks and/or having many partially defined bytes.

  - Addition of GDB server monitor command 'block_list' that lists
    the addresses/sizes of the blocks of a leak search loss record.

  - Addition of GDB server monitor command 'who_points_at' that lists
    the locations pointing at a block.

  - If a redzone size > 0 is given, VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK now will
    detect an invalid access of these redzones, by marking them
    noaccess.  Similarly, if a redzone size is given for a memory
    pool, VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_ALLOC will mark the redzones no access.
    This still allows to find some bugs if the user has forgotten to
    mark the pool superblock noaccess.

  - Performance of memory leak check has been improved, especially in
    cases where there are many leaked blocks and/or many suppression
    rules used to suppress leak reports.

  - Reduced noise (false positive) level on MacOSX 10.6/10.7, due to
    more precise analysis, which is important for LLVM/Clang
    generated code.  This is at the cost of somewhat reduced
    performance.  Note there is no change to analysis precision or
    costs on Linux targets.

* DRD:

  - Added even more facilities that can help finding the cause of a data
    race, namely the command-line option --ptrace-addr and the macro
    DRD_STOP_TRACING_VAR(x). More information can be found in the manual.

  - Fixed a subtle bug that could cause false positive data race reports.

* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================

* The C++ demangler has been updated so as to work well with C++ 
  compiled by up to at least g++ 4.6.

* Tool developers can make replacement/wrapping more flexible thanks
  to the new option --soname-synonyms.  This was reported above, but
  in fact is very general and applies to all function
  replacement/wrapping, not just to malloc-family functions.

* Round-robin scheduling of threads can be selected, using the new
  option --fair-sched= yes.  Prior to this change, the pipe-based
  thread serialisation mechanism (which is still the default) could
  give very unfair scheduling.  --fair-sched=yes improves
  responsiveness of interactive multithreaded applications, and
  improves repeatability of results from the thread checkers Helgrind
  and DRD.

* For tool developers: support to run Valgrind on Valgrind has been
  improved.  We can now routinely Valgrind on Helgrind or Memcheck.

* gdbserver now shows the float shadow registers as integer
  rather than float values, as the shadow values are mostly
  used as bit patterns.

* Increased limit for the --num-callers command line flag to 500.

* Performance improvements for error matching when there are many
  suppression records in use.

* Improved support for DWARF4 debugging information (bug 284184).

* Initial support for DWZ compressed Dwarf debug info.

* Improved control over the IR optimiser's handling of the tradeoff
  between performance and precision of exceptions.  Specifically,
  --vex-iropt-precise-memory-exns has been removed and replaced by
  --vex-iropt-register-updates, with extended functionality.  This
  allows the Valgrind gdbserver to always show up to date register
  values to GDB.

* Modest performance gains through the use of translation chaining for
  JIT-generated code.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=valgrind) rather
than mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that
are not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.7.0 (5 November 2011)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.7.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,
PPC64/Linux, S390X/Linux, ARM/Android, X86/Darwin and AMD64/Darwin.
Support for recent distros and toolchain components (glibc 2.14, gcc
4.6, MacOSX 10.7) has been added.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Support for IBM z/Architecture (s390x) running Linux.  Valgrind can
  analyse 64-bit programs running on z/Architecture.  Most user space
  instructions up to and including z10 are supported.  Valgrind has
  been tested extensively on z9, z10, and z196 machines running SLES
  10/11, RedHat 5/6m, and Fedora. The Memcheck and Massif tools are
  known to work well. Callgrind, Helgrind, and DRD work reasonably
  well on z9 and later models. See README.s390 for more details.

* Preliminary support for MacOSX 10.7 and XCode 4.  Both 32- and
  64-bit processes are supported.  Some complex threaded applications
  (Firefox) are observed to hang when run as 32 bit applications,
  whereas 64-bit versions run OK.  The cause is unknown.  Memcheck
  will likely report some false errors.  In general, expect some rough
  spots.  This release also supports MacOSX 10.6, but drops support
  for 10.5.

* Preliminary support for Android (on ARM).  Valgrind can now run
  large applications (eg, Firefox) on (eg) a Samsung Nexus S.  See
  README.android for more details, plus instructions on how to get
  started.

* Support for the IBM Power ISA 2.06 (Power7 instructions)

* General correctness and performance improvements for ARM/Linux, and,
  by extension, ARM/Android.

* Further solidification of support for SSE 4.2 in 64-bit mode.  AVX
  instruction set support is under development but is not available in
  this release.

* Support for AIX5 has been removed.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================

* Memcheck: some incremental changes:

  - reduction of memory use in some circumstances

  - improved handling of freed memory, which in some circumstances 
    can cause detection of use-after-free that would previously have
    been missed

  - fix of a longstanding bug that could cause false negatives (missed
    errors) in programs doing vector saturated narrowing instructions.

* Helgrind: performance improvements and major memory use reductions,
  particularly for large, long running applications which perform many
  synchronisation (lock, unlock, etc) events.  Plus many smaller
  changes:

  - display of locksets for both threads involved in a race

  - general improvements in formatting/clarity of error messages

  - addition of facilities and documentation regarding annotation
    of thread safe reference counted C++ classes

  - new flag --check-stack-refs=no|yes [yes], to disable race checking
    on thread stacks (a performance hack)

  - new flag --free-is-write=no|yes [no], to enable detection of races
    where one thread accesses heap memory but another one frees it,
    without any coordinating synchronisation event

* DRD: enabled XML output; added support for delayed thread deletion
  in order to detect races that occur close to the end of a thread
  (--join-list-vol); fixed a memory leak triggered by repeated client
  memory allocatation and deallocation; improved Darwin support.

* exp-ptrcheck: this tool has been renamed to exp-sgcheck

* exp-sgcheck: this tool has been reduced in scope so as to improve
  performance and remove checking that Memcheck does better.
  Specifically, the ability to check for overruns for stack and global
  arrays is unchanged, but the ability to check for overruns of heap
  blocks has been removed.  The tool has accordingly been renamed to
  exp-sgcheck ("Stack and Global Array Checking").

* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================

* GDB server: Valgrind now has an embedded GDB server.  That means it
  is possible to control a Valgrind run from GDB, doing all the usual
  things that GDB can do (single stepping, breakpoints, examining
  data, etc).  Tool-specific functionality is also available.  For
  example, it is possible to query the definedness state of variables
  or memory from within GDB when running Memcheck; arbitrarily large
  memory watchpoints are supported, etc.  To use the GDB server, start
  Valgrind with the flag --vgdb-error=0 and follow the on-screen
  instructions.

* Improved support for unfriendly self-modifying code: a new option
  --smc-check=all-non-file is available.  This adds the relevant
  consistency checks only to code that originates in non-file-backed
  mappings.  In effect this confines the consistency checking only to
  code that is or might be JIT generated, and avoids checks on code
  that must have been compiled ahead of time.  This significantly
  improves performance on applications that generate code at run time.

* It is now possible to build a working Valgrind using Clang-2.9 on
  Linux.

* new client requests VALGRIND_{DISABLE,ENABLE}_ERROR_REPORTING.
  These enable and disable error reporting on a per-thread, and
  nestable, basis.  This is useful for hiding errors in particularly
  troublesome pieces of code.  The MPI wrapper library (libmpiwrap.c)
  now uses this facility.

* Added the --mod-funcname option to cg_diff.

* ==================== FIXED BUGS ====================

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than
mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that are
not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.6.1 (16 February 2011)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.6.1 is a bug fix release.  It adds support for some SSE4
instructions that were omitted in 3.6.0 due to lack of time.  Initial
support for glibc-2.13 has been added.  A number of bugs causing
crashing or assertion failures have been fixed.

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than
mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that are
not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.6.0 (21 October 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.6.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,
PPC64/Linux, X86/Darwin and AMD64/Darwin.  Support for recent distros
and toolchain components (glibc 2.12, gcc 4.5, OSX 10.6) has been added.

                    -------------------------

Here are some highlights.  Details are shown further down:

* Support for ARM/Linux.

* Support for recent Linux distros: Ubuntu 10.10 and Fedora 14.

* Support for Mac OS X 10.6, both 32- and 64-bit executables.

* Support for the SSE4.2 instruction set.

* Enhancements to the Callgrind profiler, including the ability to
  handle CPUs with three levels of cache.

* A new experimental heap profiler, DHAT.

* A huge number of bug fixes and small enhancements.

                    -------------------------

Here are details of the above changes, together with descriptions of
many other changes, and a list of fixed bugs.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Support for ARM/Linux.  Valgrind now runs on ARMv7 capable CPUs
  running Linux.  It is known to work on Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 10.10,
  and Maemo 5, so you can run Valgrind on your Nokia N900 if you want.

  This requires a CPU capable of running the ARMv7-A instruction set
  (Cortex A5, A8 and A9).  Valgrind provides fairly complete coverage
  of the user space instruction set, including ARM and Thumb integer
  code, VFPv3, NEON and V6 media instructions.  The Memcheck,
  Cachegrind and Massif tools work properly; other tools work to
  varying degrees.

* Support for recent Linux distros (Ubuntu 10.10 and Fedora 14), along
  with support for recent releases of the underlying toolchain
  components, notably gcc-4.5 and glibc-2.12.

* Support for Mac OS X 10.6, both 32- and 64-bit executables.  64-bit
  support also works much better on OS X 10.5, and is as solid as
  32-bit support now.

* Support for the SSE4.2 instruction set.  SSE4.2 is supported in
  64-bit mode.  In 32-bit mode, support is only available up to and
  including SSSE3.  Some exceptions: SSE4.2 AES instructions are not
  supported in 64-bit mode, and 32-bit mode does in fact support the
  bare minimum SSE4 instructions to needed to run programs on Mac OS X
  10.6 on 32-bit targets.

* Support for IBM POWER6 cpus has been improved.  The Power ISA up to
  and including version 2.05 is supported.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================

* Cachegrind has a new processing script, cg_diff, which finds the
  difference between two profiles.  It's very useful for evaluating
  the performance effects of a change in a program.
  
  Related to this change, the meaning of cg_annotate's (rarely-used)
  --threshold option has changed; this is unlikely to affect many
  people, if you do use it please see the user manual for details.

* Callgrind now can do branch prediction simulation, similar to
  Cachegrind.  In addition, it optionally can count the number of
  executed global bus events.  Both can be used for a better
  approximation of a "Cycle Estimation" as derived event (you need to
  update the event formula in KCachegrind yourself).

* Cachegrind and Callgrind now refer to the LL (last-level) cache
  rather than the L2 cache.  This is to accommodate machines with
  three levels of caches -- if Cachegrind/Callgrind auto-detects the
  cache configuration of such a machine it will run the simulation as
  if the L2 cache isn't present.  This means the results are less
  likely to match the true result for the machine, but
  Cachegrind/Callgrind's results are already only approximate, and
  should not be considered authoritative.  The results are still
  useful for giving a general idea about a program's locality.

* Massif has a new option, --pages-as-heap, which is disabled by
  default.  When enabled, instead of tracking allocations at the level
  of heap blocks (as allocated with malloc/new/new[]), it instead
  tracks memory allocations at the level of memory pages (as mapped by
  mmap, brk, etc).  Each mapped page is treated as its own block.
  Interpreting the page-level output is harder than the heap-level
  output, but this option is useful if you want to account for every
  byte of memory used by a program.

* DRD has two new command-line options: --free-is-write and
  --trace-alloc.  The former allows to detect reading from already freed
  memory, and the latter allows tracing of all memory allocations and
  deallocations.

* DRD has several new annotations.  Custom barrier implementations can
  now be annotated, as well as benign races on static variables.

* DRD's happens before / happens after annotations have been made more
  powerful, so that they can now also be used to annotate e.g. a smart
  pointer implementation.

* Helgrind's annotation set has also been drastically improved, so as
  to provide to users a general set of annotations to describe locks,
  semaphores, barriers and condition variables.  Annotations to
  describe thread-safe reference counted heap objects have also been
  added.

* Memcheck has a new command-line option, --show-possibly-lost, which
  is enabled by default.  When disabled, the leak detector will not
  show possibly-lost blocks.

* A new experimental heap profiler, DHAT (Dynamic Heap Analysis Tool),
  has been added.  DHAT keeps track of allocated heap blocks, and also
  inspects every memory reference to see which block (if any) is being
  accessed.  This gives a lot of insight into block lifetimes,
  utilisation, turnover, liveness, and the location of hot and cold
  fields.  You can use DHAT to do hot-field profiling.

* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================

* Improved support for unfriendly self-modifying code: the extra
  overhead incurred by --smc-check=all has been reduced by
  approximately a factor of 5 as compared with 3.5.0.

* Ability to show directory names for source files in error messages.
  This is combined with a flexible mechanism for specifying which
  parts of the paths should be shown.  This is enabled by the new flag
  --fullpath-after.

* A new flag, --require-text-symbol, which will stop the run if a
  specified symbol is not found it a given shared object when it is
  loaded into the process.  This makes advanced working with function
  intercepting and wrapping safer and more reliable.

* Improved support for the Valkyrie GUI, version 2.0.0.  GUI output
  and control of Valgrind is now available for the tools Memcheck and
  Helgrind.  XML output from Valgrind is available for Memcheck,
  Helgrind and exp-Ptrcheck.

* More reliable stack unwinding on amd64-linux, particularly in the
  presence of function wrappers, and with gcc-4.5 compiled code.

* Modest scalability (performance improvements) for massive
  long-running applications, particularly for those with huge amounts
  of code.

* Support for analyzing programs running under Wine with has been
  improved.  The header files <valgrind/valgrind.h>,
  <valgrind/memcheck.h> and <valgrind/drd.h> can now be used in
  Windows-programs compiled with MinGW or one of the Microsoft Visual
  Studio compilers.

* A rare but serious error in the 64-bit x86 CPU simulation was fixed.
  The 32-bit simulator was not affected.  This did not occur often,
  but when it did would usually crash the program under test.
  Bug 245925.

* A large number of bugs were fixed.  These are shown below.

* A number of bugs were investigated, and were candidates for fixing,
  but are not fixed in 3.6.0, due to lack of developer time.  They may
  get fixed in later releases.  They are:

Release 3.5.0 (19 August 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.5.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.  The main improvement is that Valgrind
now works on Mac OS X.

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux, PPC64/Linux
and X86/Darwin.  Support for recent distros and toolchain components
(glibc 2.10, gcc 4.5) has been added.

                    -------------------------

Here is a short summary of the changes.  Details are shown further
down:

* Support for Mac OS X (10.5.x).

* Improvements and simplifications to Memcheck's leak checker.

* Clarification and simplifications in various aspects of Valgrind's
  text output.

* XML output for Helgrind and Ptrcheck.

* Performance and stability improvements for Helgrind and DRD.

* Genuinely atomic support for x86/amd64/ppc atomic instructions.

* A new experimental tool, BBV, useful for computer architecture
  research.

* Improved Wine support, including ability to read Windows PDB
  debuginfo.

                    -------------------------

Here are details of the above changes, followed by descriptions of
many other minor changes, and a list of fixed bugs.


* Valgrind now runs on Mac OS X.  (Note that Mac OS X is sometimes
  called "Darwin" because that is the name of the OS core, which is the
  level that Valgrind works at.)

  Supported systems:

  - It requires OS 10.5.x (Leopard).  Porting to 10.4.x is not planned
    because it would require work and 10.4 is only becoming less common.

  - 32-bit programs on x86 and AMD64 (a.k.a x86-64) machines are supported
    fairly well.  For 10.5.x, 32-bit programs are the default even on
    64-bit machines, so it handles most current programs.
    
  - 64-bit programs on x86 and AMD64 (a.k.a x86-64) machines are not
    officially supported, but simple programs at least will probably work.
    However, start-up is slow.

  - PowerPC machines are not supported.

  Things that don't work:

  - The Ptrcheck tool.

  - Objective-C garbage collection.

  - --db-attach=yes.

  - If you have Rogue Amoeba's "Instant Hijack" program installed,
    Valgrind will fail with a SIGTRAP at start-up.  See
    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193917 for details and a
    simple work-around.

  Usage notes:

  - You will likely find --dsymutil=yes a useful option, as error
    messages may be imprecise without it.

  - Mac OS X support is new and therefore will be less robust than the
    Linux support.  Please report any bugs you find.

  - Threaded programs may run more slowly than on Linux.

  Many thanks to Greg Parker for developing this port over several years.


* Memcheck's leak checker has been improved.  

  - The results for --leak-check=summary now match the summary results
    for --leak-check=full.  Previously they could differ because
    --leak-check=summary counted "indirectly lost" blocks and
    "suppressed" blocks as "definitely lost".

  - Blocks that are only reachable via at least one interior-pointer,
    but are directly pointed to by a start-pointer, were previously
    marked as "still reachable".  They are now correctly marked as
    "possibly lost".

  - The default value for the --leak-resolution option has been
    changed from "low" to "high".  In general, this means that more
    leak reports will be produced, but each leak report will describe
    fewer leaked blocks.

  - With --leak-check=full, "definitely lost" and "possibly lost"
    leaks are now considered as proper errors, ie. they are counted
    for the "ERROR SUMMARY" and affect the behaviour of
    --error-exitcode.  These leaks are not counted as errors if
    --leak-check=summary is specified, however.

  - Documentation for the leak checker has been improved.


* Various aspects of Valgrind's text output have changed.

  - Valgrind's start-up message has changed.  It is shorter but also
    includes the command being run, which makes it easier to use
    --trace-children=yes.  An example:

  - Valgrind's shut-down messages have also changed.  This is most
    noticeable with Memcheck, where the leak summary now occurs before
    the error summary.  This change was necessary to allow leaks to be
    counted as proper errors (see the description of the leak checker
    changes above for more details).  This was also necessary to fix a
    longstanding bug in which uses of suppressions against leaks were
    not "counted", leading to difficulties in maintaining suppression
    files (see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186790).

  - Behavior of -v has changed.  In previous versions, -v printed out
    a mixture of marginally-user-useful information, and tool/core
    statistics.  The statistics printing has now been moved to its own
    flag, --stats=yes.  This means -v is less verbose and more likely
    to convey useful end-user information.

  - The format of some (non-XML) stack trace entries has changed a
    little.  Previously there were six possible forms:

      0x80483BF: really (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: really (in /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: really
      0x80483BF: (within /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: ??? (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: ???

    The third and fourth of these forms have been made more consistent
    with the others.  The six possible forms are now:
  
      0x80483BF: really (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: really (in /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: really (in ???)
      0x80483BF: ??? (in /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: ??? (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: ???

    Stack traces produced when --xml=yes is specified are different
    and unchanged.


* Helgrind and Ptrcheck now support XML output, so they can be used
  from GUI tools.  Also, the XML output mechanism has been
  overhauled.

  - The XML format has been overhauled and generalised, so it is more
    suitable for error reporting tools in general.  The Memcheck
    specific aspects of it have been removed.  The new format, which
    is an evolution of the old format, is described in
    docs/internals/xml-output-protocol4.txt.

  - Memcheck has been updated to use the new format.

  - Helgrind and Ptrcheck are now able to emit output in this format.

  - The XML output mechanism has been overhauled.  XML is now output
    to its own file descriptor, which means that:

    * Valgrind can output text and XML independently.

    * The longstanding problem of XML output being corrupted by 
      unexpected un-tagged text messages  is solved.

    As before, the destination for text output is specified using
    --log-file=, --log-fd= or --log-socket=.

    As before, XML output for a tool is enabled using --xml=yes.

    Because there's a new XML output channel, the XML output
    destination is now specified by --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or
    --xml-socket=.

    Initial feedback has shown this causes some confusion.  To
    clarify, the two envisaged usage scenarios are:

    (1) Normal text output.  In this case, do not specify --xml=yes
        nor any of --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or --xml-socket=.

    (2) XML output.  In this case, specify --xml=yes, and one of
        --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or --xml-socket= to select the XML
        destination, one of --log-file=, --log-fd= or --log-socket=
        to select the destination for any remaining text messages,
        and, importantly, -q.

        -q makes Valgrind completely silent on the text channel,
        except in the case of critical failures, such as Valgrind
        itself segfaulting, or failing to read debugging information.
        Hence, in this scenario, it suffices to check whether or not
        any output appeared on the text channel.  If yes, then it is
        likely to be a critical error which should be brought to the
        attention of the user.  If no (the text channel produced no
        output) then it can be assumed that the run was successful.

        This allows GUIs to make the critical distinction they need to
        make (did the run fail or not?) without having to search or
        filter the text output channel in any way.

    It is also recommended to use --child-silent-after-fork=yes in
    scenario (2).


* Improvements and changes in Helgrind:

  - XML output, as described above

  - Checks for consistent association between pthread condition
    variables and their associated mutexes are now performed.

  - pthread_spinlock functions are supported.

  - Modest performance improvements.

  - Initial (skeletal) support for describing the behaviour of
    non-POSIX synchronisation objects through ThreadSanitizer
    compatible ANNOTATE_* macros.

  - More controllable tradeoffs between performance and the level of
    detail of "previous" accesses in a race.  There are now three
    settings:

    * --history-level=full.  This is the default, and was also the
      default in 3.4.x.  It shows both stacks involved in a race, but
      requires a lot of memory and can be very slow in programs that
      do many inter-thread synchronisation events.

    * --history-level=none.  This only shows the later stack involved
      in a race.  This can be much faster than --history-level=full,
      but makes it much more difficult to find the other access
      involved in the race.

    The new intermediate setting is

    * --history-level=approx

      For the earlier (other) access, two stacks are presented.  The
      earlier access is guaranteed to be somewhere in between the two
      program points denoted by those stacks.  This is not as useful
      as showing the exact stack for the previous access (as per
      --history-level=full), but it is better than nothing, and it's
      almost as fast as --history-level=none.


* New features and improvements in DRD:

  - The error messages printed by DRD are now easier to interpret.
    Instead of using two different numbers to identify each thread
    (Valgrind thread ID and DRD thread ID), DRD does now identify
    threads via a single number (the DRD thread ID).  Furthermore
    "first observed at" information is now printed for all error
    messages related to synchronization objects.

  - Added support for named semaphores (sem_open() and sem_close()).

  - Race conditions between pthread_barrier_wait() and
    pthread_barrier_destroy() calls are now reported.

  - Added support for custom allocators through the macros
    VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK() VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK() (defined in
    in <valgrind/valgrind.h>). An alternative for these two macros is
    the new client request VG_USERREQ__DRD_CLEAN_MEMORY (defined in
    <valgrind/drd.h>).

  - Added support for annotating non-POSIX synchronization objects
    through several new ANNOTATE_*() macros.

  - OpenMP: added support for the OpenMP runtime (libgomp) included
    with gcc versions 4.3.0 and 4.4.0.

  - Faster operation.

  - Added two new command-line options (--first-race-only and
    --segment-merging-interval).


* Genuinely atomic support for x86/amd64/ppc atomic instructions

  Valgrind will now preserve (memory-access) atomicity of LOCK-
  prefixed x86/amd64 instructions, and any others implying a global
  bus lock.  Ditto for PowerPC l{w,d}arx/st{w,d}cx. instructions.

  This means that Valgrinded processes will "play nicely" in
  situations where communication with other processes, or the kernel,
  is done through shared memory and coordinated with such atomic
  instructions.  Prior to this change, such arrangements usually
  resulted in hangs, races or other synchronisation failures, because
  Valgrind did not honour atomicity of such instructions.


* A new experimental tool, BBV, has been added.  BBV generates basic
  block vectors for use with the SimPoint analysis tool, which allows
  a program's overall behaviour to be approximated by running only a
  fraction of it.  This is useful for computer architecture
  researchers.  You can run BBV by specifying --tool=exp-bbv (the
  "exp-" prefix is short for "experimental").  BBV was written by
  Vince Weaver.


* Modestly improved support for running Windows applications under
  Wine.  In particular, initial support for reading Windows .PDB debug
  information has been added.


* A new Memcheck client request VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAK_BLOCKS has been
  added.  It is similar to VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAKS but counts blocks
  instead of bytes.


* The Valgrind client requests VALGRIND_PRINTF and
  VALGRIND_PRINTF_BACKTRACE have been changed slightly.  Previously,
  the string was always printed immediately on its own line.  Now, the
  string will be added to a buffer but not printed until a newline is
  encountered, or other Valgrind output is printed (note that for
  VALGRIND_PRINTF_BACKTRACE, the back-trace itself is considered
  "other Valgrind output").  This allows you to use multiple
  VALGRIND_PRINTF calls to build up a single output line, and also to
  print multiple output lines with a single request (by embedding
  multiple newlines in the string).


* The graphs drawn by Massif's ms_print program have changed slightly:

  - The half-height chars '.' and ',' are no longer drawn, because
    they are confusing.  The --y option can be used if the default
    y-resolution is not high enough.

  - Horizontal lines are now drawn after the top of a snapshot if
    there is a gap until the next snapshot.  This makes it clear that
    the memory usage has not dropped to zero between snapshots.


* Something that happened in 3.4.0, but wasn't clearly announced: the
  option --read-var-info=yes can be used by some tools (Memcheck,
  Helgrind and DRD).  When enabled, it causes Valgrind to read DWARF3
  variable type and location information.  This makes those tools
  start up more slowly and increases memory consumption, but
  descriptions of data addresses in error messages become more
  detailed.


* exp-Omega, an experimental instantaneous leak-detecting tool, was
  disabled in 3.4.0 due to a lack of interest and maintenance,
  although the source code was still in the distribution.  The source
  code has now been removed from the distribution.  For anyone
  interested, the removal occurred in SVN revision r10247.


* Some changes have been made to the build system.

  - VEX/ is now integrated properly into the build system.  This means
    that dependency tracking within VEX/ now works properly, "make
    install" will work without requiring "make" before it, and
    parallel builds (ie. 'make -j') now work (previously a
    .NOTPARALLEL directive was used to serialize builds, ie. 'make -j'
    was effectively ignored).

  - The --with-vex configure option has been removed.  It was of
    little use and removing it simplified the build system.

  - The location of some install files has changed.  This should not
    affect most users.  Those who might be affected:

    * For people who use Valgrind with MPI programs, the installed
      libmpiwrap.so library has moved from
      $(INSTALL)/<platform>/libmpiwrap.so to
      $(INSTALL)/libmpiwrap-<platform>.so.

    * For people who distribute standalone Valgrind tools, the
      installed libraries such as $(INSTALL)/<platform>/libcoregrind.a
      have moved to $(INSTALL)/libcoregrind-<platform>.a.

    These changes simplify the build system.

  - Previously, all the distributed suppression (*.supp) files were
    installed.  Now, only default.supp is installed.  This should not
    affect users as the other installed suppression files were not
    read; the fact that they were installed was a mistake.


* KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

  - Memcheck is unusable with the Intel compiler suite version 11.1,
    when it generates code for SSE2-and-above capable targets.  This
    is because of icc's use of highly optimised inlined strlen
    implementations.  It causes Memcheck to report huge numbers of
    false errors even in simple programs.  Helgrind and DRD may also
    have problems.

    Versions 11.0 and earlier may be OK, but this has not been
    properly tested.

Release 3.4.1 (28 February 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.4.1 is a bug-fix release that fixes some regressions and assertion
failures in debug info reading in 3.4.0, most notably incorrect stack
traces on amd64-linux on older (glibc-2.3 based) systems. Various
other debug info problems are also fixed.  A number of bugs in the
exp-ptrcheck tool introduced in 3.4.0 have been fixed.

In view of the fact that 3.4.0 contains user-visible regressions
relative to 3.3.x, upgrading to 3.4.1 is recommended.  Packagers are
encouraged to ship 3.4.1 in preference to 3.4.0.

The fixed bugs are as follows.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for "not in
bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but never got a
bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in bugzilla
(http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than mailing the
developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that are not entered
into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.4.0 (2 January 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.4.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.  This release supports X86/Linux,
AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux and PPC64/Linux.  Support for recent distros
(using gcc 4.4, glibc 2.8 and 2.9) has been added.

3.4.0 brings some significant tool improvements.  Memcheck can now
report the origin of uninitialised values, the thread checkers
Helgrind and DRD are much improved, and we have a new experimental
tool, exp-Ptrcheck, which is able to detect overruns of stack and
global arrays.  In detail:

* Memcheck is now able to track the origin of uninitialised values.
  When it reports an uninitialised value error, it will try to show
  the origin of the value, as either a heap or stack allocation.
  Origin tracking is expensive and so is not enabled by default.  To
  use it, specify --track-origins=yes.  Memcheck's speed will be
  essentially halved, and memory usage will be significantly
  increased.  Nevertheless it can drastically reduce the effort
  required to identify the root cause of uninitialised value errors,
  and so is often a programmer productivity win, despite running more
  slowly.

* A version (1.4.0) of the Valkyrie GUI, that works with Memcheck in
  3.4.0, will be released shortly.

* Helgrind's race detection algorithm has been completely redesigned
  and reimplemented, to address usability and scalability concerns:

  - The new algorithm has a lower false-error rate: it is much less
    likely to report races that do not really exist.

  - Helgrind will display full call stacks for both accesses involved
    in a race.  This makes it easier to identify the root causes of
    races.

  - Limitations on the size of program that can run have been removed.

  - Performance has been modestly improved, although that is very
    workload-dependent.

  - Direct support for Qt4 threading has been added.

  - pthread_barriers are now directly supported.

  - Helgrind works well on all supported Linux targets.

* The DRD thread debugging tool has seen major improvements:

  - Greatly improved performance and significantly reduced memory
    usage.

  - Support for several major threading libraries (Boost.Thread, Qt4,
    glib, OpenMP) has been added.

  - Support for atomic instructions, POSIX semaphores, barriers and
    reader-writer locks has been added.

  - Works now on PowerPC CPUs too.

  - Added support for printing thread stack usage at thread exit time.

  - Added support for debugging lock contention.

  - Added a manual for Drd.

* A new experimental tool, exp-Ptrcheck, has been added.  Ptrcheck
  checks for misuses of pointers.  In that sense it is a bit like
  Memcheck.  However, Ptrcheck can do things Memcheck can't: it can
  detect overruns of stack and global arrays, it can detect
  arbitrarily far out-of-bounds accesses to heap blocks, and it can
  detect accesses heap blocks that have been freed a very long time
  ago (millions of blocks in the past).

  Ptrcheck currently works only on x86-linux and amd64-linux.  To use
  it, use --tool=exp-ptrcheck.  A simple manual is provided, as part
  of the main Valgrind documentation.  As this is an experimental
  tool, we would be particularly interested in hearing about your
  experiences with it.

* exp-Omega, an experimental instantaneous leak-detecting tool, is no
  longer built by default, although the code remains in the repository
  and the tarball.  This is due to three factors: a perceived lack of
  users, a lack of maintenance, and concerns that it may not be
  possible to achieve reliable operation using the existing design.

* As usual, support for the latest Linux distros and toolchain
  components has been added.  It should work well on Fedora Core 10,
  OpenSUSE 11.1 and Ubuntu 8.10.  gcc-4.4 (in its current pre-release
  state) is supported, as is glibc-2.9.  The C++ demangler has been
  updated so as to work well with C++ compiled by even the most recent
  g++'s.

* You can now use frame-level wildcards in suppressions.  This was a
  frequently-requested enhancement.  A line "..." in a suppression now
  matches zero or more frames.  This makes it easier to write
  suppressions which are precise yet insensitive to changes in
  inlining behaviour.

* 3.4.0 adds support on x86/amd64 for the SSSE3 instruction set.

* Very basic support for IBM Power6 has been added (64-bit processes only).

* Valgrind is now cross-compilable.  For example, it is possible to
  cross compile Valgrind on an x86/amd64-linux host, so that it runs
  on a ppc32/64-linux target.

* You can set the main thread's stack size at startup using the
  new --main-stacksize= flag (subject of course to ulimit settings).
  This is useful for running apps that need a lot of stack space.

* The limitation that you can't use --trace-children=yes together
  with --db-attach=yes has been removed.

* The following bugs have been fixed.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for
  "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but
  never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
  bugzilla (http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than
  mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly.

Developer-visible changes:

* Valgrind's debug-info reading machinery has been majorly overhauled.
  It can now correctly establish the addresses for ELF data symbols,
  which is something that has never worked properly before now.

  Also, Valgrind can now read DWARF3 type and location information for
  stack and global variables.  This makes it possible to use the
  framework to build tools that rely on knowing the type and locations
  of stack and global variables, for example exp-Ptrcheck.

  Reading of such information is disabled by default, because most
  tools don't need it, and because it is expensive in space and time.
  However, you can force Valgrind to read it, using the
  --read-var-info=yes flag.  Memcheck, Helgrind and DRD are able to
  make use of such information, if present, to provide source-level
  descriptions of data addresses in the error messages they create.
