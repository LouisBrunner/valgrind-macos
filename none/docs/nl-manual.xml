<title>Nulgrind: the ``null'' tool</title>
<subtitle>A tool that does not very much at all</subtitle>

<para>Nulgrind is the minimal tool for Valgrind.  It does no
initialisation or finalisation, and adds no instrumentation to
the program's code.  It is mainly of use for Valgrind's
developers for debugging and regression testing.</para>

<para>Nonetheless you can run programs with Nulgrind.  They will
run roughly 5 times more slowly than normal, for no useful
effect.  Note that you need to use the option
<computeroutput>--tool=none</computeroutput> to run Nulgrind
(ie. not <computeroutput>--tool=nulgrind</computeroutput>).</para>
