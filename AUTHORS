Julian Seward was the original author, creating the
dynamic translation framework, memcheck stuff, and the
signal/syscall/threads support gunk.

Nicholas Nethercote did the core/tool generalisation, and wrote
Cachegrind and some of the other tools, and tons of other stuff.

Jeremy Fitzhardinge wrote Helgrind, and lots of syscall/signal
simulation stuff, including a complete redesign of how syscalls and
signals are handled.  Also code generation improvements.

Tom Hughes did a vast number of bug fixes, and helped out with support
for more recent Linux/glibc versions.

Robert Walsh added file descriptor leakage checking, new library
interception machinery, support for client allocation pools, and minor
other tweakage.

readelf's dwarf2 source line reader, written by Nick Clifton, was
modified to be used in Valgrind by Daniel Berlin.

Michael Matz and Simon Hausmann modified the GNU binutils
demangler(s) for use in Valgrind.

Dirk Mueller contrib'd the malloc-free mismatch checking stuff,
and other bits and pieces.

Lots of other people sent bug reports, patches, and very 
helpful feedback.  I thank you all.
