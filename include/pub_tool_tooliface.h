   //   uses it.
   //
   // * closure->nraddr is the non-redirected guest address of the
   //   start of the translation.  In other words, the translation is

   //   closure->nraddr but no translation of it was found.
   //
   // * closure->readdr is the redirected guest address, from which
   //   the translation was really made.
   //
   //   To clarify this, consider what happens when, in Memcheck, the
   //   first call to malloc() happens.  The guest program will be
   //   trying to jump to malloc() in libc; hence ->nraddr will contain
   //   that address.  However, Memcheck intercepts and replaces
   //   malloc, hence ->readdr will be the address of Memcheck's
   //   malloc replacement in
   //   coregrind/m_replacemalloc/vg_replacemalloc.c.  It follows
   //   that the first IMark in the translation will be labelled as
   //   from ->readdr rather than ->nraddr.
   //
   //   Since most functions are not redirected, the majority of the
   //   time ->nraddr will be the same as ->readdr.  However, you
   //   cannot assume this: if your tool has metadata associated
   //   with code addresses it will get into deep trouble if it does
   //   make this assumption.

   // VexGuestLayout* layout contains limited info on the layout of
   // the guest state: where the stack pointer and program counter
   // are, and which fields should be regarded as 'always defined'.
   // Memcheck uses this.
   //
   // VexGuestExtents* vge points to a structure which states the
   // precise byte ranges of original code from which this translation
   // was made (there may be up to three different ranges involved).
   // Note again that these are the real addresses from which the code
   // came.  And so it should be the case that closure->readdr is the
   // same as vge->base[0]; indeed Cachegrind contains this assertion.
   //
   // Tools which associate shadow data with code addresses
   // (cachegrind, callgrind) need to be particularly clear about
   // whether they are making the association with redirected or

   // but you do need to understand what's going on.  See comments

   /*
      In the incoming IRSB, the IR for each instruction begins with an
      IRStmt_IMark, which states the address and length of the
      instruction from which this IR came.  This makes it easy for
      profiling-style tools to know precisely which guest code
      addresses are being executed.

      However, before the first IRStmt_IMark, there may be other IR
      statements -- a preamble.  In most cases this preamble is empty,
      but when it isn't, what it contains is some supporting IR that
      the JIT uses to ensure control flow works correctly.  This
      preamble does not modify any architecturally defined guest state
      (registers or memory) and so does not contain anything that will
      be of interest to your tool.

      You should therefore 

      (1) copy any IR preceding the first IMark verbatim to the start
          of the output IRSB.

      (2) not try to instrument it or modify it in any way.

      For the record, stuff that may be in the preamble at
      present is:

      - A self-modifying-code check has been requested for this block.
        The preamble will contain instructions to checksum the block,
        compare against the expected value, and exit the dispatcher
        requesting a discard (hence forcing a retranslation) if they
        don't match.

      - This block is known to be the entry point of a wrapper of some
        function F.  In this case the preamble contains code to write
        the address of the original F (the fn being wrapped) into a
        'hidden' guest state register _NRADDR.  The wrapper can later
        read this register using a client request and make a
        non-redirected call to it using another client-request-like
        magic macro.

      - For platforms that use the AIX ABI (including ppc64-linux), it
        is necessary to have a preamble even for replacement functions
        (not just for wrappers), because it is necessary to switch the
        R2 register (constant-pool pointer) to a different value when
        swizzling the program counter.

        Hence the preamble pushes both R2 and LR (the return address)
        on a small 16-entry stack in the guest state and sets R2 to an
        appropriate value for the wrapper/replacement fn.  LR is then
        set so that the wrapper/replacement fn returns to a magic IR
        stub which restores R2 and LR and returns.

        It's all hugely ugly and fragile.  And it places a stringent
        requirement on m_debuginfo to find out the correct R2 (toc
        pointer) value for the wrapper/replacement function.  So much
        so that m_redir will refuse to honour a redirect-to-me request
        if it cannot find (by asking m_debuginfo) a plausible R2 value
        for 'me'.

        Because this mechanism maintains a shadow stack of (R2,LR)
        pairs in the guest state, it will fail if the
        wrapper/redirection function, or anything it calls, longjumps
        out past the wrapper, because then the magic return stub will
        not be run and so the shadow stack will not be popped.  So it
        will quickly fill up.  Fortunately none of this applies to
        {x86,amd64,ppc32}-linux; on those platforms, wrappers can
        longjump and recurse arbitrarily and everything should work
        fine.

      Note that copying the preamble verbatim may cause complications
      for your instrumenter if you shadow IR temporaries.  See big
      comment in MC_(instrument) in memcheck/mc_translate.c for
      details.

   Memory events (Nb: to track heap allocation/freeing, a tool must replace
   malloc() et al.  See above how to do this.)

   These ones occur at startup, upon some signals, and upon some syscalls.

   For new_mem_brk and new_mem_stack_signal, the supplied ThreadId
   indicates the thread for whom the new memory is being allocated.

   For new_mem_startup and new_mem_mmap, the di_handle argument is a
   handle which can be used to retrieve debug info associated with the
   mapping or allocation (because it is of a file that Valgrind has
   decided to read debug info from).  If the value is zero, there is
   no associated debug info.  If the value exceeds zero, it can be
   supplied as an argument to selected queries in m_debuginfo.

/* These ones are called when SP changes.  A tool could track these itself

   The specialised ones are called in preference to the general one, if they
   are defined.  These functions are called a lot if they are used, so
   specialising can optimise things significantly.  If any of the
   specialised cases are defined, the general case must be defined too.

   Nb: all the specialised ones must use the VG_REGPARM(n) attribute.

   For the _new functions, a tool may specify with with-ECU
   (ExeContext Unique) or without-ECU version for each size, but not
   both.  If the with-ECU version is supplied, then the core will
   arrange to pass, as the ecu argument, a 32-bit int which uniquely
   identifies the instruction moving the stack pointer down.  This
   32-bit value is as obtained from VG_(get_ECU_from_ExeContext).
   VG_(get_ExeContext_from_ECU) can then be used to retrieve the
   associated depth-1 ExeContext for the location.  All this
   complexity is provided to support origin tracking in Memcheck.

/* Thread events (not exhaustive)

   ll_create: low level thread creation.  Called before the new thread
   has run any instructions (or touched any memory).  In fact, called
   immediately before the new thread has come into existence; the new
   thread can be assumed to exist when notified by this call.

   ll_exit: low level thread exit.  Called after the exiting thread
   has run its last instruction.

   The _ll_ part makes it clear these events are not to do with
   pthread_create or pthread_exit/pthread_join (etc), which are a
   higher level abstraction synthesised by libpthread.  What you can
   be sure of from _ll_create/_ll_exit is the absolute limits of each
   thread's lifetime, and hence be assured that all memory references
   made by the thread fall inside the _ll_create/_ll_exit pair.  This
   is important for tools that need a 100% accurate account of which
   thread is responsible for every memory reference in the process.

   pthread_create/join/exit do not give this property.  Calls/returns
   to/from them happen arbitrarily far away from the relevant
   low-level thread create/quit event.  In general a few hundred
   instructions; hence a few hundred(ish) memory references could get
   misclassified each time.

   pre_thread_first_insn: is called when the thread is all set up and
   ready to go (stack in place, etc) but has not executed its first
   instruction yet.  Gives threading tools a chance to ask questions
   about the thread (eg, what is its initial client stack pointer)
   that are not easily answered at pre_thread_ll_create time.

   For a given thread, the call sequence is:
      ll_create (in the parent's context)
      first_insn (in the child's context)
      ll_exit (in the child's context)
