//--------------------------------------------------------------------
// PURPOSE: Provides efficient allocation and free of elements of
// the same size.
// This pool allocator manages elements alloc/free by allocating
// "pools" of many elements from a lower level allocator (typically
// pub_tool_mallocfree.h).
// Single elements can then be allocated and released from these pools.
// A pool allocator is faster and has less memory overhead than
// calling directly pub_tool_mallocfree.h
// Note: the pools of elements are not freed, even if all the
// single elements have been freed. The only way to free the underlying
// pools of elements is to delete the pool allocator.
