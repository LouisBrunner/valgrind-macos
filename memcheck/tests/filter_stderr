# Stack traces ending in syscalls often cause problems, with lots of libc
# variations: different numbers of entries, line numbers or not depending on
# whether libc debug info is present, 'writev' vs 'do_writev', 'main' vs.
# '(below main)', etc.  
#
# So we just cut out the entire stack trace.  It's coarse but effective, and
# there aren't that many cases like this, and the error line gives the
# syscall name.  
#
# The '<' is to avoid matching the XML case;  we don't use '>' because that
# appears in some of the syscall parameter names (eg "act->sa_handler").
