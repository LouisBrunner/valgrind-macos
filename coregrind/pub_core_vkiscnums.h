// PURPOSE: This module holds all the syscall numbers, and a handful of
// operations relating to them.
//
// On Linux they are a bunch of #define'd constants of the form
// __NR_name, and this file must contain nothing else, since it will
// be included in assembly code (m_trampoline.S).
//
// On Darwin the __NR_name consts are #define'd constants which are
// encoded using various macros.  32- and 64-bit Darwin share a common
// "implementation" also.
//
// Note that most of the actual code for this module is in include/vki/, but
// you should not directly #include any file in include/vki; instead #include
// only one of pub_{core,tool}_vkiscnums{,_asm}.h.
//--------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Most unfortunately, all the kernel decls are visible to tools.  Not
   really necessary, but to avoid this would require some tedious
   refactoring of the sources.  Anyway, we live with this kludge, and
   that means the only thing to be done here is ... */
