// The basic stack trace type:  just an array of code addresses.
typedef Addr* StackTrace;

// Walks the stack to get instruction pointers from the top stack frames 
// for thread 'tid'.  Maximum of 'n_ips' addresses put into 'ips';
// 0 is the top of the stack, 1 is its caller, etc.  Everything from
// ips[return_value] onwards is undefined and should not be read.
// The initial IP value to use is adjusted by first_ip_delta before
// the stack is unwound. A safe value to pass is zero.
//
// The specific meaning of the returned addresses is:
//
// [0] is the IP of thread 'tid'
// [1] points to the last byte of the call instruction that called [0].
// [2] points to the last byte of the call instruction that called [1].
// etc etc
//
// Hence ips[0 .. return_value-1] should all point to currently
// 'active' (in the sense of a stack of unfinished function calls)
// instructions.  [0] points to the start of an arbitrary instruction.#
// [1 ..] point to the last byte of a chain of call instructions.
//
// If sps and fps are non-NULL, the corresponding frame-pointer and
// stack-pointer values for each frame are stored there.
