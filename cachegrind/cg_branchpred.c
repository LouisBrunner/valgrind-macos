/* This file contains the actual branch predictor simulator and its
   associated state.  As with cg_sim.c it is #included directly into
   cg_main.c.  It provides:

   - a taken/not-taken predictor for conditional branches
   - a branch target address predictor for indirect branches

   Function return-address prediction is not modelled, on the basis
   that return stack predictors almost always predict correctly, and
   also that it is difficult for Valgrind to robustly identify
   function calls and returns.

/* Get a taken/not-taken prediction for the instruction (presumably a
   conditional branch) at instr_addr.  Once that's done, update the
   predictor state based on whether or not it was actually taken, as
   indicated by 'taken'.  Finally, return 1 for a mispredict and 0 for
   a successful predict.

   The predictor is an array of 16k (== 2^14) 2-bit saturating
   counters.  Given the address of the branch instruction, the array
   index to use is computed both from the low order bits of the branch
   instruction's address, and the global history - that is, from the
   taken/not-taken behaviour of the most recent few branches.  This
   makes the predictor able to correlate this branch's behaviour with
   that of other branches. 

   TODO: use predictor written by someone who understands this stuff.
   Perhaps it would be better to move to a standard GShare predictor
   and/or tournament predictor.

   the bottom.  These numbers chosen somewhat arbitrarily, but note
   that making N_IADD_BITS too small (eg 4) can cause large amounts of

   are mostly unchanging. */
