# gdb 7.2 sometimes tries to access address 0x0 (same as with standard gdbserver)

# filter a debian 6.0/ppc32 line

# filter some missing info msg from s390

# Bypass a s390x kernel bug which makes faultstatus test3 fail. In our case, we are
# not interested in checking the si_code, but rather the signal passing
# in mcsig(no)pass
#
# When doing inferior function calls from gdb (in mcmain_pic) there might be
# extra heap usage from gdb that we aren't interested in tracking.
