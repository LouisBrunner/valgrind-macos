/* VEX can sometimes generate code which returns to the dispatcher
   with the guest state pointer set to VEX_TRC_JMP_EMWARN or 
   VEX_TRC_JMP_EMFAIL.  This means that VEX is trying to tell Valgrind
   something noteworthy about emulation progress. For example, that Valgrind
   is doing imprecise emulation in some sense.  The guest's pseudo-register
   "guest_EMNOTE" will hold a value of type VexEmNote, which describes
   the nature of the warning.  Currently the limitations that are
   warned about apply primarily to floating point support.

   All guest states must have a 32-bit (UInt) guest_EMNOTE pseudo-
   register, that emulation warnings can be written in to.

   Note that guest_EMNOTE only carries a valid value at the jump
   marked as VEX_TRC_JMP_EMWARN / VEX_TRC_JMP_EMFAIL.  You can't assume
   it will continue to carry a valid value from any amount of time after
   the jump.
