Release 3.7.0 (???)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added the --mod-funcname option to cg_diff.
- Further reduction in overheads caused by --smc-check=all, especially
  on 64-bit targets.

* IBM z/Architecture (s390x) running Linux
  Valgrind can analyse 64-bit programs running on z/Architecture.
  Most user space instructions up to and including z10 are supported.
  Valgrind has been tested extensively on z9, z10, and z196 machines
  running SLES 10/11, RedHat 5/6m, and Fedora. The Memcheck and Massif
  tools are known to work well. Callgrind, Helgrind, and DRD work
  reasonably well on z9 and later models. See README.s390 for more
  details.


Release 3.6.1 (16 February 2011)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.6.1 is a bug fix release.  It adds support for some SSE4
instructions that were omitted in 3.6.0 due to lack of time.  Initial
support for glibc-2.13 has been added.  A number of bugs causing
crashing or assertion failures have been fixed.

The following bugs have been fixed or resolved.  Note that "n-i-bz"
stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
bugzilla (http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than
mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that are
not entered into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.6.0 (21 October 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.6.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM/Linux, PPC32/Linux,
PPC64/Linux, X86/Darwin and AMD64/Darwin.  Support for recent distros
and toolchain components (glibc 2.12, gcc 4.5, OSX 10.6) has been added.

                    -------------------------

Here are some highlights.  Details are shown further down:

* Support for ARM/Linux.

* Support for recent Linux distros: Ubuntu 10.10 and Fedora 14.

* Support for Mac OS X 10.6, both 32- and 64-bit executables.

* Support for the SSE4.2 instruction set.

* Enhancements to the Callgrind profiler, including the ability to
  handle CPUs with three levels of cache.

* A new experimental heap profiler, DHAT.

* A huge number of bug fixes and small enhancements.

                    -------------------------

Here are details of the above changes, together with descriptions of
many other changes, and a list of fixed bugs.

* ================== PLATFORM CHANGES =================

* Support for ARM/Linux.  Valgrind now runs on ARMv7 capable CPUs
  running Linux.  It is known to work on Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 10.10,
  and Maemo 5, so you can run Valgrind on your Nokia N900 if you want.

  This requires a CPU capable of running the ARMv7-A instruction set
  (Cortex A5, A8 and A9).  Valgrind provides fairly complete coverage
  of the user space instruction set, including ARM and Thumb integer
  code, VFPv3, NEON and V6 media instructions.  The Memcheck,
  Cachegrind and Massif tools work properly; other tools work to
  varying degrees.

* Support for recent Linux distros (Ubuntu 10.10 and Fedora 14), along
  with support for recent releases of the underlying toolchain
  components, notably gcc-4.5 and glibc-2.12.

* Support for Mac OS X 10.6, both 32- and 64-bit executables.  64-bit
  support also works much better on OS X 10.5, and is as solid as
  32-bit support now.

* Support for the SSE4.2 instruction set.  SSE4.2 is supported in
  64-bit mode.  In 32-bit mode, support is only available up to and
  including SSSE3.  Some exceptions: SSE4.2 AES instructions are not
  supported in 64-bit mode, and 32-bit mode does in fact support the
  bare minimum SSE4 instructions to needed to run programs on Mac OS X
  10.6 on 32-bit targets.

* Support for IBM POWER6 cpus has been improved.  The Power ISA up to
  and including version 2.05 is supported.

* ==================== TOOL CHANGES ====================

* Cachegrind has a new processing script, cg_diff, which finds the
  difference between two profiles.  It's very useful for evaluating
  the performance effects of a change in a program.
  
  Related to this change, the meaning of cg_annotate's (rarely-used)
  --threshold option has changed; this is unlikely to affect many
  people, if you do use it please see the user manual for details.

* Callgrind now can do branch prediction simulation, similar to
  Cachegrind.  In addition, it optionally can count the number of
  executed global bus events.  Both can be used for a better
  approximation of a "Cycle Estimation" as derived event (you need to
  update the event formula in KCachegrind yourself).

* Cachegrind and Callgrind now refer to the LL (last-level) cache
  rather than the L2 cache.  This is to accommodate machines with
  three levels of caches -- if Cachegrind/Callgrind auto-detects the
  cache configuration of such a machine it will run the simulation as
  if the L2 cache isn't present.  This means the results are less
  likely to match the true result for the machine, but
  Cachegrind/Callgrind's results are already only approximate, and
  should not be considered authoritative.  The results are still
  useful for giving a general idea about a program's locality.

* Massif has a new option, --pages-as-heap, which is disabled by
  default.  When enabled, instead of tracking allocations at the level
  of heap blocks (as allocated with malloc/new/new[]), it instead
  tracks memory allocations at the level of memory pages (as mapped by
  mmap, brk, etc).  Each mapped page is treated as its own block.
  Interpreting the page-level output is harder than the heap-level
  output, but this option is useful if you want to account for every
  byte of memory used by a program.

* DRD has two new command-line options: --free-is-write and
  --trace-alloc.  The former allows to detect reading from already freed
  memory, and the latter allows tracing of all memory allocations and
  deallocations.

* DRD has several new annotations.  Custom barrier implementations can
  now be annotated, as well as benign races on static variables.

* DRD's happens before / happens after annotations have been made more
  powerful, so that they can now also be used to annotate e.g. a smart
  pointer implementation.

* Helgrind's annotation set has also been drastically improved, so as
  to provide to users a general set of annotations to describe locks,
  semaphores, barriers and condition variables.  Annotations to
  describe thread-safe reference counted heap objects have also been
  added.

* Memcheck has a new command-line option, --show-possibly-lost, which
  is enabled by default.  When disabled, the leak detector will not
  show possibly-lost blocks.

* A new experimental heap profiler, DHAT (Dynamic Heap Analysis Tool),
  has been added.  DHAT keeps track of allocated heap blocks, and also
  inspects every memory reference to see which block (if any) is being
  accessed.  This gives a lot of insight into block lifetimes,
  utilisation, turnover, liveness, and the location of hot and cold
  fields.  You can use DHAT to do hot-field profiling.

* ==================== OTHER CHANGES ====================

* Improved support for unfriendly self-modifying code: the extra
  overhead incurred by --smc-check=all has been reduced by
  approximately a factor of 5 as compared with 3.5.0.

* Ability to show directory names for source files in error messages.
  This is combined with a flexible mechanism for specifying which
  parts of the paths should be shown.  This is enabled by the new flag
  --fullpath-after.

* A new flag, --require-text-symbol, which will stop the run if a
  specified symbol is not found it a given shared object when it is
  loaded into the process.  This makes advanced working with function
  intercepting and wrapping safer and more reliable.

* Improved support for the Valkyrie GUI, version 2.0.0.  GUI output
  and control of Valgrind is now available for the tools Memcheck and
  Helgrind.  XML output from Valgrind is available for Memcheck,
  Helgrind and exp-Ptrcheck.

* More reliable stack unwinding on amd64-linux, particularly in the
  presence of function wrappers, and with gcc-4.5 compiled code.

* Modest scalability (performance improvements) for massive
  long-running applications, particularly for those with huge amounts
  of code.

* Support for analyzing programs running under Wine with has been
  improved.  The header files <valgrind/valgrind.h>,
  <valgrind/memcheck.h> and <valgrind/drd.h> can now be used in
  Windows-programs compiled with MinGW or one of the Microsoft Visual
  Studio compilers.

* A rare but serious error in the 64-bit x86 CPU simulation was fixed.
  The 32-bit simulator was not affected.  This did not occur often,
  but when it did would usually crash the program under test.
  Bug 245925.

* A large number of bugs were fixed.  These are shown below.

* A number of bugs were investigated, and were candidates for fixing,
  but are not fixed in 3.6.0, due to lack of developer time.  They may
  get fixed in later releases.  They are:

stands for "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us
but never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in

Release 3.5.0 (19 August 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.5.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.  The main improvement is that Valgrind
now works on Mac OS X.

This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux, PPC64/Linux
and X86/Darwin.  Support for recent distros and toolchain components
(glibc 2.10, gcc 4.5) has been added.

                    -------------------------

Here is a short summary of the changes.  Details are shown further
down:

* Support for Mac OS X (10.5.x).

* Improvements and simplifications to Memcheck's leak checker.

* Clarification and simplifications in various aspects of Valgrind's
  text output.

* XML output for Helgrind and Ptrcheck.

* Performance and stability improvements for Helgrind and DRD.

* Genuinely atomic support for x86/amd64/ppc atomic instructions.

* A new experimental tool, BBV, useful for computer architecture
  research.

* Improved Wine support, including ability to read Windows PDB
  debuginfo.

                    -------------------------

Here are details of the above changes, followed by descriptions of
many other minor changes, and a list of fixed bugs.


* Valgrind now runs on Mac OS X.  (Note that Mac OS X is sometimes
  called "Darwin" because that is the name of the OS core, which is the
  level that Valgrind works at.)

  Supported systems:

  - It requires OS 10.5.x (Leopard).  Porting to 10.4.x is not planned
    because it would require work and 10.4 is only becoming less common.

  - 32-bit programs on x86 and AMD64 (a.k.a x86-64) machines are supported
    fairly well.  For 10.5.x, 32-bit programs are the default even on
    64-bit machines, so it handles most current programs.
    
  - 64-bit programs on x86 and AMD64 (a.k.a x86-64) machines are not
    officially supported, but simple programs at least will probably work.
    However, start-up is slow.

  - PowerPC machines are not supported.

  Things that don't work:

  - The Ptrcheck tool.

  - Objective-C garbage collection.

  - --db-attach=yes.

  - If you have Rogue Amoeba's "Instant Hijack" program installed,
    Valgrind will fail with a SIGTRAP at start-up.  See
    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193917 for details and a
    simple work-around.

  Usage notes:

  - You will likely find --dsymutil=yes a useful option, as error
    messages may be imprecise without it.

  - Mac OS X support is new and therefore will be less robust than the
    Linux support.  Please report any bugs you find.

  - Threaded programs may run more slowly than on Linux.

  Many thanks to Greg Parker for developing this port over several years.


* Memcheck's leak checker has been improved.  

  - The results for --leak-check=summary now match the summary results
    for --leak-check=full.  Previously they could differ because
    --leak-check=summary counted "indirectly lost" blocks and
    "suppressed" blocks as "definitely lost".

  - Blocks that are only reachable via at least one interior-pointer,
    but are directly pointed to by a start-pointer, were previously
    marked as "still reachable".  They are now correctly marked as
    "possibly lost".

  - The default value for the --leak-resolution option has been
    changed from "low" to "high".  In general, this means that more
    leak reports will be produced, but each leak report will describe
    fewer leaked blocks.

  - With --leak-check=full, "definitely lost" and "possibly lost"
    leaks are now considered as proper errors, ie. they are counted
    for the "ERROR SUMMARY" and affect the behaviour of
    --error-exitcode.  These leaks are not counted as errors if
    --leak-check=summary is specified, however.

  - Documentation for the leak checker has been improved.


* Various aspects of Valgrind's text output have changed.

  - Valgrind's start-up message has changed.  It is shorter but also
    includes the command being run, which makes it easier to use
    --trace-children=yes.  An example:

  - Valgrind's shut-down messages have also changed.  This is most
    noticeable with Memcheck, where the leak summary now occurs before
    the error summary.  This change was necessary to allow leaks to be
    counted as proper errors (see the description of the leak checker
    changes above for more details).  This was also necessary to fix a
    longstanding bug in which uses of suppressions against leaks were
    not "counted", leading to difficulties in maintaining suppression
    files (see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186790).

  - Behavior of -v has changed.  In previous versions, -v printed out
    a mixture of marginally-user-useful information, and tool/core
    statistics.  The statistics printing has now been moved to its own
    flag, --stats=yes.  This means -v is less verbose and more likely
    to convey useful end-user information.

  - The format of some (non-XML) stack trace entries has changed a
    little.  Previously there were six possible forms:

      0x80483BF: really (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: really (in /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: really
      0x80483BF: (within /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: ??? (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: ???

    The third and fourth of these forms have been made more consistent
    with the others.  The six possible forms are now:
  
      0x80483BF: really (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: really (in /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: really (in ???)
      0x80483BF: ??? (in /foo/a.out)
      0x80483BF: ??? (a.c:20)
      0x80483BF: ???

    Stack traces produced when --xml=yes is specified are different
    and unchanged.


* Helgrind and Ptrcheck now support XML output, so they can be used
  from GUI tools.  Also, the XML output mechanism has been
  overhauled.

  - The XML format has been overhauled and generalised, so it is more
    suitable for error reporting tools in general.  The Memcheck
    specific aspects of it have been removed.  The new format, which
    is an evolution of the old format, is described in
    docs/internals/xml-output-protocol4.txt.

  - Memcheck has been updated to use the new format.

  - Helgrind and Ptrcheck are now able to emit output in this format.

  - The XML output mechanism has been overhauled.  XML is now output
    to its own file descriptor, which means that:

    * Valgrind can output text and XML independently.

    * The longstanding problem of XML output being corrupted by 
      unexpected un-tagged text messages  is solved.

    As before, the destination for text output is specified using
    --log-file=, --log-fd= or --log-socket=.

    As before, XML output for a tool is enabled using --xml=yes.

    Because there's a new XML output channel, the XML output
    destination is now specified by --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or
    --xml-socket=.

    Initial feedback has shown this causes some confusion.  To
    clarify, the two envisaged usage scenarios are:

    (1) Normal text output.  In this case, do not specify --xml=yes
        nor any of --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or --xml-socket=.

    (2) XML output.  In this case, specify --xml=yes, and one of
        --xml-file=, --xml-fd= or --xml-socket= to select the XML
        destination, one of --log-file=, --log-fd= or --log-socket=
        to select the destination for any remaining text messages,
        and, importantly, -q.

        -q makes Valgrind completely silent on the text channel,
        except in the case of critical failures, such as Valgrind
        itself segfaulting, or failing to read debugging information.
        Hence, in this scenario, it suffices to check whether or not
        any output appeared on the text channel.  If yes, then it is
        likely to be a critical error which should be brought to the
        attention of the user.  If no (the text channel produced no
        output) then it can be assumed that the run was successful.

        This allows GUIs to make the critical distinction they need to
        make (did the run fail or not?) without having to search or
        filter the text output channel in any way.

    It is also recommended to use --child-silent-after-fork=yes in
    scenario (2).


* Improvements and changes in Helgrind:

  - XML output, as described above

  - Checks for consistent association between pthread condition
    variables and their associated mutexes are now performed.

  - pthread_spinlock functions are supported.

  - Modest performance improvements.

  - Initial (skeletal) support for describing the behaviour of
    non-POSIX synchronisation objects through ThreadSanitizer
    compatible ANNOTATE_* macros.

  - More controllable tradeoffs between performance and the level of
    detail of "previous" accesses in a race.  There are now three
    settings:

    * --history-level=full.  This is the default, and was also the
      default in 3.4.x.  It shows both stacks involved in a race, but
      requires a lot of memory and can be very slow in programs that
      do many inter-thread synchronisation events.

    * --history-level=none.  This only shows the later stack involved
      in a race.  This can be much faster than --history-level=full,
      but makes it much more difficult to find the other access
      involved in the race.

    The new intermediate setting is

    * --history-level=approx

      For the earlier (other) access, two stacks are presented.  The
      earlier access is guaranteed to be somewhere in between the two
      program points denoted by those stacks.  This is not as useful
      as showing the exact stack for the previous access (as per
      --history-level=full), but it is better than nothing, and it's
      almost as fast as --history-level=none.


* New features and improvements in DRD:

  - The error messages printed by DRD are now easier to interpret.
    Instead of using two different numbers to identify each thread
    (Valgrind thread ID and DRD thread ID), DRD does now identify
    threads via a single number (the DRD thread ID).  Furthermore
    "first observed at" information is now printed for all error
    messages related to synchronization objects.

  - Added support for named semaphores (sem_open() and sem_close()).

  - Race conditions between pthread_barrier_wait() and
    pthread_barrier_destroy() calls are now reported.

  - Added support for custom allocators through the macros
    VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK() VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK() (defined in
    in <valgrind/valgrind.h>). An alternative for these two macros is
    the new client request VG_USERREQ__DRD_CLEAN_MEMORY (defined in
    <valgrind/drd.h>).

  - Added support for annotating non-POSIX synchronization objects
    through several new ANNOTATE_*() macros.

  - OpenMP: added support for the OpenMP runtime (libgomp) included
    with gcc versions 4.3.0 and 4.4.0.

  - Faster operation.

  - Added two new command-line options (--first-race-only and
    --segment-merging-interval).


* Genuinely atomic support for x86/amd64/ppc atomic instructions

  Valgrind will now preserve (memory-access) atomicity of LOCK-
  prefixed x86/amd64 instructions, and any others implying a global
  bus lock.  Ditto for PowerPC l{w,d}arx/st{w,d}cx. instructions.

  This means that Valgrinded processes will "play nicely" in
  situations where communication with other processes, or the kernel,
  is done through shared memory and coordinated with such atomic
  instructions.  Prior to this change, such arrangements usually
  resulted in hangs, races or other synchronisation failures, because
  Valgrind did not honour atomicity of such instructions.


* A new experimental tool, BBV, has been added.  BBV generates basic
  block vectors for use with the SimPoint analysis tool, which allows
  a program's overall behaviour to be approximated by running only a
  fraction of it.  This is useful for computer architecture
  researchers.  You can run BBV by specifying --tool=exp-bbv (the
  "exp-" prefix is short for "experimental").  BBV was written by
  Vince Weaver.


* Modestly improved support for running Windows applications under
  Wine.  In particular, initial support for reading Windows .PDB debug
  information has been added.


* A new Memcheck client request VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAK_BLOCKS has been
  added.  It is similar to VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAKS but counts blocks
  instead of bytes.


* The Valgrind client requests VALGRIND_PRINTF and
  VALGRIND_PRINTF_BACKTRACE have been changed slightly.  Previously,
  the string was always printed immediately on its own line.  Now, the
  string will be added to a buffer but not printed until a newline is
  encountered, or other Valgrind output is printed (note that for
  VALGRIND_PRINTF_BACKTRACE, the back-trace itself is considered
  "other Valgrind output").  This allows you to use multiple
  VALGRIND_PRINTF calls to build up a single output line, and also to
  print multiple output lines with a single request (by embedding
  multiple newlines in the string).


* The graphs drawn by Massif's ms_print program have changed slightly:

  - The half-height chars '.' and ',' are no longer drawn, because
    they are confusing.  The --y option can be used if the default
    y-resolution is not high enough.

  - Horizontal lines are now drawn after the top of a snapshot if
    there is a gap until the next snapshot.  This makes it clear that
    the memory usage has not dropped to zero between snapshots.


* Something that happened in 3.4.0, but wasn't clearly announced: the
  option --read-var-info=yes can be used by some tools (Memcheck,
  Helgrind and DRD).  When enabled, it causes Valgrind to read DWARF3
  variable type and location information.  This makes those tools
  start up more slowly and increases memory consumption, but
  descriptions of data addresses in error messages become more
  detailed.


* exp-Omega, an experimental instantaneous leak-detecting tool, was
  disabled in 3.4.0 due to a lack of interest and maintenance,
  although the source code was still in the distribution.  The source
  code has now been removed from the distribution.  For anyone
  interested, the removal occurred in SVN revision r10247.


* Some changes have been made to the build system.

  - VEX/ is now integrated properly into the build system.  This means
    that dependency tracking within VEX/ now works properly, "make
    install" will work without requiring "make" before it, and
    parallel builds (ie. 'make -j') now work (previously a
    .NOTPARALLEL directive was used to serialize builds, ie. 'make -j'
    was effectively ignored).

  - The --with-vex configure option has been removed.  It was of
    little use and removing it simplified the build system.

  - The location of some install files has changed.  This should not
    affect most users.  Those who might be affected:

    * For people who use Valgrind with MPI programs, the installed
      libmpiwrap.so library has moved from
      $(INSTALL)/<platform>/libmpiwrap.so to
      $(INSTALL)/libmpiwrap-<platform>.so.

    * For people who distribute standalone Valgrind tools, the
      installed libraries such as $(INSTALL)/<platform>/libcoregrind.a
      have moved to $(INSTALL)/libcoregrind-<platform>.a.

    These changes simplify the build system.

  - Previously, all the distributed suppression (*.supp) files were
    installed.  Now, only default.supp is installed.  This should not
    affect users as the other installed suppression files were not
    read; the fact that they were installed was a mistake.


* KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

  - Memcheck is unusable with the Intel compiler suite version 11.1,
    when it generates code for SSE2-and-above capable targets.  This
    is because of icc's use of highly optimised inlined strlen
    implementations.  It causes Memcheck to report huge numbers of
    false errors even in simple programs.  Helgrind and DRD may also
    have problems.

    Versions 11.0 and earlier may be OK, but this has not been
    properly tested.

Release 3.4.1 (28 February 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.4.1 is a bug-fix release that fixes some regressions and assertion
failures in debug info reading in 3.4.0, most notably incorrect stack
traces on amd64-linux on older (glibc-2.3 based) systems. Various
other debug info problems are also fixed.  A number of bugs in the
exp-ptrcheck tool introduced in 3.4.0 have been fixed.

In view of the fact that 3.4.0 contains user-visible regressions
relative to 3.3.x, upgrading to 3.4.1 is recommended.  Packagers are
encouraged to ship 3.4.1 in preference to 3.4.0.

The fixed bugs are as follows.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for "not in
bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but never got a
bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in bugzilla
(http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than mailing the
developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that are not entered
into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

n-i-bz  Fix various bugs reading icc-11 generated debug info
n-i-bz  Fix various bugs reading gcc-4.4 generated debug info

Release 3.4.0 (2 January 2009)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.4.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.  This release supports X86/Linux,
AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux and PPC64/Linux.  Support for recent distros
(using gcc 4.4, glibc 2.8 and 2.9) has been added.

3.4.0 brings some significant tool improvements.  Memcheck can now
report the origin of uninitialised values, the thread checkers
Helgrind and DRD are much improved, and we have a new experimental
tool, exp-Ptrcheck, which is able to detect overruns of stack and
global arrays.  In detail:

* Memcheck is now able to track the origin of uninitialised values.
  When it reports an uninitialised value error, it will try to show
  the origin of the value, as either a heap or stack allocation.
  Origin tracking is expensive and so is not enabled by default.  To
  use it, specify --track-origins=yes.  Memcheck's speed will be
  essentially halved, and memory usage will be significantly
  increased.  Nevertheless it can drastically reduce the effort
  required to identify the root cause of uninitialised value errors,
  and so is often a programmer productivity win, despite running more
  slowly.

* A version (1.4.0) of the Valkyrie GUI, that works with Memcheck in
  3.4.0, will be released shortly.

* Helgrind's race detection algorithm has been completely redesigned
  and reimplemented, to address usability and scalability concerns:

  - The new algorithm has a lower false-error rate: it is much less
    likely to report races that do not really exist.

  - Helgrind will display full call stacks for both accesses involved
    in a race.  This makes it easier to identify the root causes of
    races.

  - Limitations on the size of program that can run have been removed.

  - Performance has been modestly improved, although that is very
    workload-dependent.

  - Direct support for Qt4 threading has been added.

  - pthread_barriers are now directly supported.

  - Helgrind works well on all supported Linux targets.

* The DRD thread debugging tool has seen major improvements:

  - Greatly improved performance and significantly reduced memory
    usage.

  - Support for several major threading libraries (Boost.Thread, Qt4,
    glib, OpenMP) has been added.

  - Support for atomic instructions, POSIX semaphores, barriers and
    reader-writer locks has been added.

  - Works now on PowerPC CPUs too.

  - Added support for printing thread stack usage at thread exit time.

  - Added support for debugging lock contention.

  - Added a manual for Drd.

* A new experimental tool, exp-Ptrcheck, has been added.  Ptrcheck
  checks for misuses of pointers.  In that sense it is a bit like
  Memcheck.  However, Ptrcheck can do things Memcheck can't: it can
  detect overruns of stack and global arrays, it can detect
  arbitrarily far out-of-bounds accesses to heap blocks, and it can
  detect accesses heap blocks that have been freed a very long time
  ago (millions of blocks in the past).

  Ptrcheck currently works only on x86-linux and amd64-linux.  To use
  it, use --tool=exp-ptrcheck.  A simple manual is provided, as part
  of the main Valgrind documentation.  As this is an experimental
  tool, we would be particularly interested in hearing about your
  experiences with it.

* exp-Omega, an experimental instantaneous leak-detecting tool, is no
  longer built by default, although the code remains in the repository
  and the tarball.  This is due to three factors: a perceived lack of
  users, a lack of maintenance, and concerns that it may not be
  possible to achieve reliable operation using the existing design.

* As usual, support for the latest Linux distros and toolchain
  components has been added.  It should work well on Fedora Core 10,
  OpenSUSE 11.1 and Ubuntu 8.10.  gcc-4.4 (in its current pre-release
  state) is supported, as is glibc-2.9.  The C++ demangler has been
  updated so as to work well with C++ compiled by even the most recent
  g++'s.

* You can now use frame-level wildcards in suppressions.  This was a
  frequently-requested enhancement.  A line "..." in a suppression now
  matches zero or more frames.  This makes it easier to write
  suppressions which are precise yet insensitive to changes in
  inlining behaviour.

* 3.4.0 adds support on x86/amd64 for the SSSE3 instruction set.

* Very basic support for IBM Power6 has been added (64-bit processes only).

* Valgrind is now cross-compilable.  For example, it is possible to
  cross compile Valgrind on an x86/amd64-linux host, so that it runs
  on a ppc32/64-linux target.

* You can set the main thread's stack size at startup using the
  new --main-stacksize= flag (subject of course to ulimit settings).
  This is useful for running apps that need a lot of stack space.

* The limitation that you can't use --trace-children=yes together
  with --db-attach=yes has been removed.

* The following bugs have been fixed.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for
  "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but
  never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
  bugzilla (http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than
  mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly.

Developer-visible changes:

* Valgrind's debug-info reading machinery has been majorly overhauled.
  It can now correctly establish the addresses for ELF data symbols,
  which is something that has never worked properly before now.

  Also, Valgrind can now read DWARF3 type and location information for
  stack and global variables.  This makes it possible to use the
  framework to build tools that rely on knowing the type and locations
  of stack and global variables, for example exp-Ptrcheck.

  Reading of such information is disabled by default, because most
  tools don't need it, and because it is expensive in space and time.
  However, you can force Valgrind to read it, using the
  --read-var-info=yes flag.  Memcheck, Helgrind and DRD are able to
  make use of such information, if present, to provide source-level
  descriptions of data addresses in the error messages they create.

Release 3.3.1 (4 June 2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.3.1 fixes a bunch of bugs in 3.3.0, adds support for glibc-2.8 based
systems (openSUSE 11, Fedora Core 9), improves the existing glibc-2.7
support, and adds support for the SSSE3 (Core 2) instruction set.

3.3.1 will likely be the last release that supports some very old
systems.  In particular, the next major release, 3.4.0, will drop
support for the old LinuxThreads threading library, and for gcc
versions prior to 3.0.

The fixed bugs are as follows.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for "not in
bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but never got a
bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in bugzilla
(http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than mailing the
developers (or mailing lists) directly -- bugs that are not entered
into bugzilla tend to get forgotten about or ignored.

Release 3.3.0 (7 December 2007)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.3.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.  This release supports X86/Linux,
AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux and PPC64/Linux.  Support for recent distros
(using gcc 4.3, glibc 2.6 and 2.7) has been added.

The main excitement in 3.3.0 is new and improved tools.  Helgrind
works again, Massif has been completely overhauled and much improved,
Cachegrind now does branch-misprediction profiling, and a new category
of experimental tools has been created, containing two new tools:
Omega and DRD.  There are many other smaller improvements.  In detail:

- Helgrind has been completely overhauled and works for the first time
  since Valgrind 2.2.0.  Supported functionality is: detection of
  misuses of the POSIX PThreads API, detection of potential deadlocks
  resulting from cyclic lock dependencies, and detection of data
  races.  Compared to the 2.2.0 Helgrind, the race detection algorithm
  has some significant improvements aimed at reducing the false error
  rate.  Handling of various kinds of corner cases has been improved.
  Efforts have been made to make the error messages easier to
  understand.  Extensive documentation is provided.

- Massif has been completely overhauled.  Instead of measuring
  space-time usage -- which wasn't always useful and many people found
  confusing -- it now measures space usage at various points in the
  execution, including the point of peak memory allocation.  Its
  output format has also changed: instead of producing PostScript
  graphs and HTML text, it produces a single text output (via the new
  'ms_print' script) that contains both a graph and the old textual
  information, but in a more compact and readable form.  Finally, the
  new version should be more reliable than the old one, as it has been
  tested more thoroughly.

- Cachegrind has been extended to do branch-misprediction profiling.
  Both conditional and indirect branches are profiled.  The default
  behaviour of Cachegrind is unchanged.  To use the new functionality,
  give the option --branch-sim=yes.

- A new category of "experimental tools" has been created.  Such tools
  may not work as well as the standard tools, but are included because
  some people will find them useful, and because exposure to a wider
  user group provides tool authors with more end-user feedback.  These
  tools have a "exp-" prefix attached to their names to indicate their
  experimental nature.  Currently there are two experimental tools:

  * exp-Omega: an instantaneous leak detector.  See
    exp-omega/docs/omega_introduction.txt.

  * exp-DRD: a data race detector based on the happens-before
    relation.  See exp-drd/docs/README.txt.

- Scalability improvements for very large programs, particularly those
  which have a million or more malloc'd blocks in use at once.  These
  improvements mostly affect Memcheck.  Memcheck is also up to 10%
  faster for all programs, with x86-linux seeing the largest
  improvement.

- Works well on the latest Linux distros.  Has been tested on Fedora
  Core 8 (x86, amd64, ppc32, ppc64) and openSUSE 10.3.  glibc 2.6 and
  2.7 are supported.  gcc-4.3 (in its current pre-release state) is
  supported.  At the same time, 3.3.0 retains support for older
  distros.

- The documentation has been modestly reorganised with the aim of
  making it easier to find information on common-usage scenarios.
  Some advanced material has been moved into a new chapter in the main
  manual, so as to unclutter the main flow, and other tidying up has
  been done.

- There is experimental support for AIX 5.3, both 32-bit and 64-bit
  processes.  You need to be running a 64-bit kernel to use Valgrind
  on a 64-bit executable.

- There have been some changes to command line options, which may
  affect you:

  * --log-file-exactly and 
    --log-file-qualifier options have been removed.

    To make up for this --log-file option has been made more powerful.
    It now accepts a %p format specifier, which is replaced with the
    process ID, and a %q{FOO} format specifier, which is replaced with
    the contents of the environment variable FOO.

  * --child-silent-after-fork=yes|no [no]

    Causes Valgrind to not show any debugging or logging output for
    the child process resulting from a fork() call.  This can make the
    output less confusing (although more misleading) when dealing with
    processes that create children.

  * --cachegrind-out-file, --callgrind-out-file and --massif-out-file

    These control the names of the output files produced by
    Cachegrind, Callgrind and Massif.  They accept the same %p and %q
    format specifiers that --log-file accepts.  --callgrind-out-file
    replaces Callgrind's old --base option.

  * Cachegrind's 'cg_annotate' script no longer uses the --<pid>
    option to specify the output file.  Instead, the first non-option
    argument is taken to be the name of the output file, and any
    subsequent non-option arguments are taken to be the names of
    source files to be annotated.

  * Cachegrind and Callgrind now use directory names where possible in
    their output files.  This means that the -I option to
    'cg_annotate' and 'callgrind_annotate' should not be needed in
    most cases.  It also means they can correctly handle the case
    where two source files in different directories have the same
    name.

- Memcheck offers a new suppression kind: "Jump".  This is for
  suppressing jump-to-invalid-address errors.  Previously you had to
  use an "Addr1" suppression, which didn't make much sense.

- Memcheck has new flags --malloc-fill=<hexnum> and
  --free-fill=<hexnum> which free malloc'd / free'd areas with the
  specified byte.  This can help shake out obscure memory corruption
  problems.  The definedness and addressability of these areas is
  unchanged -- only the contents are affected.

- The behaviour of Memcheck's client requests VALGRIND_GET_VBITS and
  VALGRIND_SET_VBITS have changed slightly.  They no longer issue
  addressability errors -- if either array is partially unaddressable,
  they just return 3 (as before).  Also, SET_VBITS doesn't report
  definedness errors if any of the V bits are undefined.

- The following Memcheck client requests have been removed:
    VALGRIND_MAKE_NOACCESS
    VALGRIND_MAKE_WRITABLE
    VALGRIND_MAKE_READABLE
    VALGRIND_CHECK_WRITABLE
    VALGRIND_CHECK_READABLE
    VALGRIND_CHECK_DEFINED
  They were deprecated in 3.2.0, when equivalent but better-named client
  requests were added.  See the 3.2.0 release notes for more details.

- The behaviour of the tool Lackey has changed slightly.  First, the output
  from --trace-mem has been made more compact, to reduce the size of the
  traces.  Second, a new option --trace-superblocks has been added, which
  shows the addresses of superblocks (code blocks) as they are executed.

- The following bugs have been fixed.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for
  "not in bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but
  never got a bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in
  bugzilla (http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than
  mailing the developers (or mailing lists) directly.

Developer-visible changes:

- The names of some functions and types within the Vex IR have
  changed.  Run 'svn log -r1689 VEX/pub/libvex_ir.h' for full details.
  Any existing standalone tools will have to be updated to reflect
  these changes.  The new names should be clearer.  The file
  VEX/pub/libvex_ir.h is also much better commented.

- A number of new debugging command line options have been added.
  These are mostly of use for debugging the symbol table and line
  number readers:

  --trace-symtab-patt=<patt> limit debuginfo tracing to obj name <patt>
  --trace-cfi=no|yes        show call-frame-info details? [no]
  --debug-dump=syms         mimic /usr/bin/readelf --syms
  --debug-dump=line         mimic /usr/bin/readelf --debug-dump=line
  --debug-dump=frames       mimic /usr/bin/readelf --debug-dump=frames
  --sym-offsets=yes|no      show syms in form 'name+offset' ? [no]

- Internally, the code base has been further factorised and
  abstractified, particularly with respect to support for non-Linux
  OSs.

Release 3.2.3 (29 Jan 2007)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately 3.2.2 introduced a regression which can cause an
assertion failure ("vex: the `impossible' happened: eqIRConst") when
running obscure pieces of SSE code.  3.2.3 fixes this and adds one
more glibc-2.5 intercept.  In all other respects it is identical to
3.2.2.  Please do not use (or package) 3.2.2; instead use 3.2.3.

n-i-bz   Add an intercept for glibc-2.5 __stpcpy_chk

(3.2.3: 29 Jan 2007, vex r1732, valgrind r6560).


Release 3.2.2 (22 Jan 2007)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.2.2 fixes a bunch of bugs in 3.2.1, adds support for glibc-2.5 based
systems (openSUSE 10.2, Fedora Core 6), improves support for icc-9.X
compiled code, and brings modest performance improvements in some
areas, including amd64 floating point, powerpc support, and startup
responsiveness on all targets.

The fixed bugs are as follows.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for "not in
bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but never got a
bugzilla entry.  We encourage you to file bugs in bugzilla
(http://bugs.kde.org/enter_valgrind_bug.cgi) rather than mailing the
developers (or mailing lists) directly.

Release 3.2.1 (16 Sept 2006)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.2.1 adds x86/amd64 support for all SSE3 instructions except monitor
and mwait, further reduces memcheck's false error rate on all
platforms, adds support for recent binutils (in OpenSUSE 10.2 and
Fedora Rawhide) and fixes a bunch of bugs in 3.2.0.  Some of the fixed
bugs were causing large programs to segfault with --tool=callgrind and
--tool=cachegrind, so an upgrade is recommended.

In view of the fact that any 3.3.0 release is unlikely to happen until
well into 1Q07, we intend to keep the 3.2.X line alive for a while
yet, and so we tentatively plan a 3.2.2 release sometime in December
06.

The fixed bugs are as follows.  Note that "n-i-bz" stands for "not in
bugzilla" -- that is, a bug that was reported to us but never got a
bugzilla entry.

The following bugs were not fixed, due primarily to lack of developer
time, and also because bug reporters did not answer requests for
feedback in time for the release:

129390   ppc?->IR: some kind of VMX prefetch (dstt)
129968   amd64->IR: 0xF 0xAE 0x0 (fxsave)

         19 July, Bennee)
132998   startup fails in when running on UML

The following bug was tentatively fixed on the mainline but the fix
was considered too risky to push into 3.2.X:

133154   crash when using client requests to register/deregister stack

(3.2.1: 16 Sept 2006, vex r1658, valgrind r6070).


Release 3.2.0 (7 June 2006)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.2.0 is a feature release with many significant improvements and the
usual collection of bug fixes.  This release supports X86/Linux,
AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux and PPC64/Linux.

Performance, especially of Memcheck, is improved, Addrcheck has been
removed, Callgrind has been added, PPC64/Linux support has been added,
Lackey has been improved, and MPI support has been added.  In detail:

- Memcheck has improved speed and reduced memory use.  Run times are
  typically reduced by 15-30%, averaging about 24% for SPEC CPU2000.
  The other tools have smaller but noticeable speed improvments.  We
  are interested to hear what improvements users get.

  Memcheck uses less memory due to the introduction of a compressed
  representation for shadow memory.  The space overhead has been
  reduced by a factor of up to four, depending on program behaviour.
  This means you should be able to run programs that use more memory
  than before without hitting problems.

- Addrcheck has been removed.  It has not worked since version 2.4.0,
  and the speed and memory improvements to Memcheck make it redundant.
  If you liked using Addrcheck because it didn't give undefined value
  errors, you can use the new Memcheck option --undef-value-errors=no
  to get the same behaviour.

- The number of undefined-value errors incorrectly reported by
  Memcheck has been reduced (such false reports were already very
  rare).  In particular, efforts have been made to ensure Memcheck
  works really well with gcc 4.0/4.1-generated code on X86/Linux and
  AMD64/Linux.

- Josef Weidendorfer's popular Callgrind tool has been added.  Folding
  it in was a logical step given its popularity and usefulness, and
  makes it easier for us to ensure it works "out of the box" on all
  supported targets.  The associated KDE KCachegrind GUI remains a
  separate project.

- A new release of the Valkyrie GUI for Memcheck, version 1.2.0,
  accompanies this release.  Improvements over previous releases
  include improved robustness, many refinements to the user interface,
  and use of a standard autoconf/automake build system.  You can get
  it from http://www.valgrind.org/downloads/guis.html.

- Valgrind now works on PPC64/Linux.  As with the AMD64/Linux port,
  this supports programs using to 32G of address space.  On 64-bit
  capable PPC64/Linux setups, you get a dual architecture build so
  that both 32-bit and 64-bit executables can be run.  Linux on POWER5
  is supported, and POWER4 is also believed to work.  Both 32-bit and
  64-bit DWARF2 is supported.  This port is known to work well with
  both gcc-compiled and xlc/xlf-compiled code.

- Floating point accuracy has been improved for PPC32/Linux.
  Specifically, the floating point rounding mode is observed on all FP
  arithmetic operations, and multiply-accumulate instructions are
  preserved by the compilation pipeline.  This means you should get FP
  results which are bit-for-bit identical to a native run.  These
  improvements are also present in the PPC64/Linux port.

- Lackey, the example tool, has been improved:

  * It has a new option --detailed-counts (off by default) which
    causes it to print out a count of loads, stores and ALU operations
    done, and their sizes.

  * It has a new option --trace-mem (off by default) which causes it
    to print out a trace of all memory accesses performed by a
    program.  It's a good starting point for building Valgrind tools
    that need to track memory accesses.  Read the comments at the top
    of the file lackey/lk_main.c for details.

  * The original instrumentation (counting numbers of instructions,
    jumps, etc) is now controlled by a new option --basic-counts.  It
    is on by default.

- MPI support: partial support for debugging distributed applications
  using the MPI library specification has been added.  Valgrind is
  aware of the memory state changes caused by a subset of the MPI
  functions, and will carefully check data passed to the (P)MPI_
  interface.

- A new flag, --error-exitcode=, has been added.  This allows changing
  the exit code in runs where Valgrind reported errors, which is
  useful when using Valgrind as part of an automated test suite.

- Various segfaults when reading old-style "stabs" debug information
  have been fixed.

- A simple performance evaluation suite has been added.  See
  perf/README and README_DEVELOPERS for details.  There are
  various bells and whistles.

- New configuration flags:
    --enable-only32bit
    --enable-only64bit
  By default, on 64 bit platforms (ppc64-linux, amd64-linux) the build
  system will attempt to build a Valgrind which supports both 32-bit
  and 64-bit executables.  This may not be what you want, and you can
  override the default behaviour using these flags.

Please note that Helgrind is still not working.  We have made an
important step towards making it work again, however, with the
addition of function wrapping (see below).

Other user-visible changes:

- Valgrind now has the ability to intercept and wrap arbitrary
  functions.  This is a preliminary step towards making Helgrind work
  again, and was required for MPI support.

- There are some changes to Memcheck's client requests.  Some of them
  have changed names:

    MAKE_NOACCESS  --> MAKE_MEM_NOACCESS
    MAKE_WRITABLE  --> MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED
    MAKE_READABLE  --> MAKE_MEM_DEFINED

    CHECK_WRITABLE --> CHECK_MEM_IS_ADDRESSABLE
    CHECK_READABLE --> CHECK_MEM_IS_DEFINED
    CHECK_DEFINED  --> CHECK_VALUE_IS_DEFINED

  The reason for the change is that the old names are subtly
  misleading.  The old names will still work, but they are deprecated
  and may be removed in a future release.

  We also added a new client request:
  
    MAKE_MEM_DEFINED_IF_ADDRESSABLE(a, len)
    
  which is like MAKE_MEM_DEFINED but only affects a byte if the byte is
  already addressable.

- The way client requests are encoded in the instruction stream has
  changed.  Unfortunately, this means 3.2.0 will not honour client
  requests compiled into binaries using headers from earlier versions
  of Valgrind.  We will try to keep the client request encodings more 
  stable in future.

Release 3.1.0 (25 November 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.1.0 is a feature release with a number of significant improvements:
AMD64 support is much improved, PPC32 support is good enough to be
usable, and the handling of memory management and address space is
much more robust.  In detail:

- AMD64 support is much improved.  The 64-bit vs. 32-bit issues in
  3.0.X have been resolved, and it should "just work" now in all
  cases.  On AMD64 machines both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of
  Valgrind are built.  The right version will be invoked
  automatically, even when using --trace-children and mixing execution
  between 64-bit and 32-bit executables.  Also, many more instructions
  are supported.

- PPC32 support is now good enough to be usable.  It should work with
  all tools, but please let us know if you have problems.  Three
  classes of CPUs are supported: integer only (no FP, no Altivec),
  which covers embedded PPC uses, integer and FP but no Altivec
  (G3-ish), and CPUs capable of Altivec too (G4, G5).

- Valgrind's address space management has been overhauled.  As a
  result, Valgrind should be much more robust with programs that use
  large amounts of memory.  There should be many fewer "memory
  exhausted" messages, and debug symbols should be read correctly on
  large (eg. 300MB+) executables.  On 32-bit machines the full address
  space available to user programs (usually 3GB or 4GB) can be fully
  utilised.  On 64-bit machines up to 32GB of space is usable; when
  using Memcheck that means your program can use up to about 14GB.

  A side effect of this change is that Valgrind is no longer protected
  against wild writes by the client.  This feature was nice but relied
  on the x86 segment registers and so wasn't portable.

- Most users should not notice, but as part of the address space
  manager change, the way Valgrind is built has been changed.  Each
  tool is now built as a statically linked stand-alone executable,
  rather than as a shared object that is dynamically linked with the
  core.  The "valgrind" program invokes the appropriate tool depending
  on the --tool option.  This slightly increases the amount of disk
  space used by Valgrind, but it greatly simplified many things and
  removed Valgrind's dependence on glibc.

Please note that Addrcheck and Helgrind are still not working.  Work
is underway to reinstate them (or equivalents).  We apologise for the
inconvenience.

Other user-visible changes:

- The --weird-hacks option has been renamed --sim-hints.

- The --time-stamp option no longer gives an absolute date and time.
  It now prints the time elapsed since the program began.

- It should build with gcc-2.96.

- Valgrind can now run itself (see README_DEVELOPERS for how).
  This is not much use to you, but it means the developers can now
  profile Valgrind using Cachegrind.  As a result a couple of
  performance bad cases have been fixed.

- The XML output format has changed slightly.  See
  docs/internals/xml-output.txt.

- Core dumping has been reinstated (it was disabled in 3.0.0 and 3.0.1).
  If your program crashes while running under Valgrind, a core file with
  the name "vgcore.<pid>" will be created (if your settings allow core
  file creation).  Note that the floating point information is not all
  there.  If Valgrind itself crashes, the OS will create a normal core
  file.

The following are some user-visible changes that occurred in earlier
versions that may not have been announced, or were announced but not
widely noticed.  So we're mentioning them now.

- The --tool flag is optional once again;  if you omit it, Memcheck
  is run by default.

- The --num-callers flag now has a default value of 12.  It was
  previously 4.

- The --xml=yes flag causes Valgrind's output to be produced in XML
  format.  This is designed to make it easy for other programs to
  consume Valgrind's output.  The format is described in the file
  docs/internals/xml-format.txt.

- The --gen-suppressions flag supports an "all" value that causes every
  suppression to be printed without asking.

- The --log-file option no longer puts "pid" in the filename, eg. the
  old name "foo.pid12345" is now "foo.12345".

- There are several graphical front-ends for Valgrind, such as Valkyrie,
  Alleyoop and Valgui.  See http://www.valgrind.org/downloads/guis.html
  for a list.

Release 3.0.0 (3 August 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3.0.0 is a major overhaul of Valgrind.  The most significant user
visible change is that Valgrind now supports architectures other than
x86.  The new architectures it supports are AMD64 and PPC32, and the
infrastructure is present for other architectures to be added later.

AMD64 support works well, but has some shortcomings:

- It generally won't be as solid as the x86 version.  For example,
  support for more obscure instructions and system calls may be missing.
  We will fix these as they arise.

- Address space may be limited; see the point about
  position-independent executables below.

- If Valgrind is built on an AMD64 machine, it will only run 64-bit
  executables.  If you want to run 32-bit x86 executables under Valgrind
  on an AMD64, you will need to build Valgrind on an x86 machine and
  copy it to the AMD64 machine.  And it probably won't work if you do
  something tricky like exec'ing a 32-bit program from a 64-bit program
  while using --trace-children=yes.  We hope to improve this situation
  in the future.

The PPC32 support is very basic.  It may not work reliably even for
small programs, but it's a start.  Many thanks to Paul Mackerras for
his great work that enabled this support.  We are working to make
PPC32 usable as soon as possible.

Other user-visible changes:

- Valgrind is no longer built by default as a position-independent
  executable (PIE), as this caused too many problems.

  Without PIE enabled, AMD64 programs will only be able to access 2GB of
  address space.  We will fix this eventually, but not for the moment.
  
  Use --enable-pie at configure-time to turn this on.

- Support for programs that use stack-switching has been improved.  Use
  the --max-stackframe flag for simple cases, and the
  VALGRIND_STACK_REGISTER, VALGRIND_STACK_DEREGISTER and
  VALGRIND_STACK_CHANGE client requests for trickier cases.

- Support for programs that use self-modifying code has been improved,
  in particular programs that put temporary code fragments on the stack.
  This helps for C programs compiled with GCC that use nested functions,
  and also Ada programs.  This is controlled with the --smc-check
  flag, although the default setting should work in most cases.

- Output can now be printed in XML format.  This should make it easier
  for tools such as GUI front-ends and automated error-processing
  schemes to use Valgrind output as input.  The --xml flag controls this.
  As part of this change, ELF directory information is read from executables,
  so absolute source file paths are available if needed.

- Programs that allocate many heap blocks may run faster, due to
  improvements in certain data structures.

- Addrcheck is currently not working.  We hope to get it working again
  soon.  Helgrind is still not working, as was the case for the 2.4.0
  release.

- The JITter has been completely rewritten, and is now in a separate
  library, called Vex.  This enabled a lot of the user-visible changes,
  such as new architecture support.  The new JIT unfortunately translates
  more slowly than the old one, so programs may take longer to start.
  We believe the code quality is produces is about the same, so once
  started, programs should run at about the same speed.  Feedback about
  this would be useful.

  On the plus side, Vex and hence Memcheck tracks value flow properly
  through floating point and vector registers, something the 2.X line
  could not do.  That means that Memcheck is much more likely to be
  usably accurate on vectorised code.

- There is a subtle change to the way exiting of threaded programs
  is handled.  In 3.0, Valgrind's final diagnostic output (leak check,
  etc) is not printed until the last thread exits.  If the last thread
  to exit was not the original thread which started the program, any
  other process wait()-ing on this one to exit may conclude it has
  finished before the diagnostic output is printed.  This may not be
  what you expect.  2.X had a different scheme which avoided this
  problem, but caused deadlocks under obscure circumstances, so we
  are trying something different for 3.0.

- Small changes in control log file naming which make it easier to
  use valgrind for debugging MPI-based programs.  The relevant
  new flags are --log-file-exactly= and --log-file-qualifier=.

- As part of adding AMD64 support, DWARF2 CFI-based stack unwinding
  support was added.  In principle this means Valgrind can produce
  meaningful backtraces on x86 code compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer
  providing you also compile your code with -fasynchronous-unwind-tables.

- The documentation build system has been completely redone.
  The documentation masters are now in XML format, and from that
  HTML, PostScript and PDF documentation is generated.  As a result
  the manual is now available in book form.  Note that the
  documentation in the source tarballs is pre-built, so you don't need
  any XML processing tools to build Valgrind from a tarball.

Changes that are not user-visible:

- The code has been massively overhauled in order to modularise it.
  As a result we hope it is easier to navigate and understand.

- Lots of code has been rewritten.

Stable release 2.4.1 (1 August 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(The notes for this release have been lost.  Sorry!  It would have
contained various bug fixes but no new features.)



Stable release 2.4.0 (March 2005) -- CHANGES RELATIVE TO 2.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.4.0 brings many significant changes and bug fixes.  The most
significant user-visible change is that we no longer supply our own
pthread implementation.  Instead, Valgrind is finally capable of
running the native thread library, either LinuxThreads or NPTL.

This means our libpthread has gone, along with the bugs associated
with it.  Valgrind now supports the kernel's threading syscalls, and
lets you use your standard system libpthread.  As a result:

* There are many fewer system dependencies and strange library-related
  bugs.  There is a small performance improvement, and a large
  stability improvement.

* On the downside, Valgrind can no longer report misuses of the POSIX
  PThreads API.  It also means that Helgrind currently does not work.
  We hope to fix these problems in a future release.

Note that running the native thread libraries does not mean Valgrind
is able to provide genuine concurrent execution on SMPs.  We still
impose the restriction that only one thread is running at any given
time.

There are many other significant changes too:

* Memcheck is (once again) the default tool.

* The default stack backtrace is now 12 call frames, rather than 4.

* Suppressions can have up to 25 call frame matches, rather than 4.

* Memcheck and Addrcheck use less memory.  Under some circumstances,
  they no longer allocate shadow memory if there are large regions of
  memory with the same A/V states - such as an mmaped file.

* The memory-leak detector in Memcheck and Addrcheck has been
  improved.  It now reports more types of memory leak, including
  leaked cycles.  When reporting leaked memory, it can distinguish
  between directly leaked memory (memory with no references), and
  indirectly leaked memory (memory only referred to by other leaked
  memory).

* Memcheck's confusion over the effect of mprotect() has been fixed:
  previously mprotect could erroneously mark undefined data as
  defined.

* Signal handling is much improved and should be very close to what
  you get when running natively.  

  One result of this is that Valgrind observes changes to sigcontexts
  passed to signal handlers.  Such modifications will take effect when
  the signal returns.  You will need to run with --single-step=yes to
  make this useful.

* Valgrind is built in Position Independent Executable (PIE) format if
  your toolchain supports it.  This allows it to take advantage of all
  the available address space on systems with 4Gbyte user address
  spaces.

* Valgrind can now run itself (requires PIE support).

* Syscall arguments are now checked for validity.  Previously all
  memory used by syscalls was checked, but now the actual values
  passed are also checked.

* Syscall wrappers are more robust against bad addresses being passed
  to syscalls: they will fail with EFAULT rather than killing Valgrind
  with SIGSEGV.

* Because clone() is directly supported, some non-pthread uses of it
  will work.  Partial sharing (where some resources are shared, and
  some are not) is not supported.

* open() and readlink() on /proc/self/exe are supported.

Stable release 2.2.0 (31 August 2004) -- CHANGES RELATIVE TO 2.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.2.0 brings nine months worth of improvements and bug fixes.  We
believe it to be a worthy successor to 2.0.0.  There are literally
hundreds of bug fixes and minor improvements.  There are also some
fairly major user-visible changes:

* A complete overhaul of handling of system calls and signals, and 
  their interaction with threads.  In general, the accuracy of the 
  system call, thread and signal simulations is much improved:

  - Blocking system calls behave exactly as they do when running
    natively (not on valgrind).  That is, if a syscall blocks only the
    calling thread when running natively, than it behaves the same on
    valgrind.  No more mysterious hangs because V doesn't know that some
    syscall or other, should block only the calling thread.

  - Interrupted syscalls should now give more faithful results.

  - Signal contexts in signal handlers are supported.

* Improvements to NPTL support to the extent that V now works 
  properly on NPTL-only setups.

* Greater isolation between Valgrind and the program being run, so
  the program is less likely to inadvertently kill Valgrind by
  doing wild writes.

* Massif: a new space profiling tool.  Try it!  It's cool, and it'll
  tell you in detail where and when your C/C++ code is allocating heap.
  Draws pretty .ps pictures of memory use against time.  A potentially
  powerful tool for making sense of your program's space use.

* File descriptor leakage checks.  When enabled, Valgrind will print out
  a list of open file descriptors on exit.

* Improved SSE2/SSE3 support.

* Time-stamped output; use --time-stamp=yes



Stable release 2.2.0 (31 August 2004) -- CHANGES RELATIVE TO 2.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.2.0 is not much different from 2.1.2, released seven weeks ago.
A number of bugs have been fixed, most notably #85658, which gave
problems for quite a few people.  There have been many internal
cleanups, but those are not user visible.

The following bugs have been fixed since 2.1.2:

85658   Assert in coregrind/vg_libpthread.c:2326 (open64) !=
        (void*)0 failed
        This bug was reported multiple times, and so the following
        duplicates of it are also fixed: 87620, 85796, 85935, 86065, 
        86919, 86988, 87917, 88156

80716   Semaphore mapping bug caused by unmap (sem_destroy)
        (Was fixed prior to 2.1.2)

86987   semctl and shmctl syscalls family is not handled properly

86696   valgrind 2.1.2 + RH AS2.1 + librt

86730   valgrind locks up at end of run with assertion failure 
        in __pthread_unwind

86641   memcheck doesn't work with Mesa OpenGL/ATI on Suse 9.1
        (also fixes 74298, a duplicate of this)

85947   MMX/SSE unhandled instruction 'sfence'

84978   Wrong error "Conditional jump or move depends on
        uninitialised value" resulting from "sbbl %reg, %reg"

86254   ssort() fails when signed int return type from comparison is 
        too small to handle result of unsigned int subtraction

87089   memalign( 4, xxx) makes valgrind assert

86407   Add support for low-level parallel port driver ioctls.

70587   Add timestamps to Valgrind output? (wishlist)

84937   vg_libpthread.c:2505 (se_remap): Assertion `res == 0'
        (fixed prior to 2.1.2)

86317   cannot load libSDL-1.2.so.0 using valgrind

86989   memcpy from mac_replace_strmem.c complains about
        uninitialized pointers passed when length to copy is zero

85811   gnu pascal symbol causes segmentation fault; ok in 2.0.0

79138   writing to sbrk()'d memory causes segfault

77369   sched deadlock while signal received during pthread_join
        and the joined thread exited

88115   In signal handler for SIGFPE,  siginfo->si_addr is wrong 
        under Valgrind

78765   Massif crashes on app exit if FP exceptions are enabled

Additionally there are the following changes, which are not 
connected to any bug report numbers, AFAICS:

* Fix scary bug causing mis-identification of SSE stores vs
  loads and so causing memcheck to sometimes give nonsense results
  on SSE code.

* Add support for the POSIX message queue system calls.

* Fix to allow 32-bit Valgrind to run on AMD64 boxes.  Note: this does
  NOT allow Valgrind to work with 64-bit executables - only with 32-bit
  executables on an AMD64 box.

* At configure time, only check whether linux/mii.h can be processed 
  so that we don't generate ugly warnings by trying to compile it.

* Add support for POSIX clocks and timers.



Developer (cvs head) release 2.1.2 (18 July 2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.1.2 contains four months worth of bug fixes and refinements.
Although officially a developer release, we believe it to be stable
enough for widespread day-to-day use.  2.1.2 is pretty good, so try it
first, although there is a chance it won't work.  If so then try 2.0.0
and tell us what went wrong."  2.1.2 fixes a lot of problems present
in 2.0.0 and is generally a much better product.

Relative to 2.1.1, a large number of minor problems with 2.1.1 have
been fixed, and so if you use 2.1.1 you should try 2.1.2.  Users of
the last stable release, 2.0.0, might also want to try this release.

The following bugs, and probably many more, have been fixed.  These
are listed at http://bugs.kde.org.  Reporting a bug for valgrind in
the http://bugs.kde.org is much more likely to get you a fix than
mailing developers directly, so please continue to keep sending bugs
there.

76869   Crashes when running any tool under Fedora Core 2 test1
        This fixes the problem with returning from a signal handler 
        when VDSOs are turned off in FC2.

69508   java 1.4.2 client fails with erroneous "stack size too small".
        This fix makes more of the pthread stack attribute related 
        functions work properly.  Java still doesn't work though.

71906   malloc alignment should be 8, not 4
        All memory returned by malloc/new etc is now at least
        8-byte aligned.

81970   vg_alloc_ThreadState: no free slots available
        (closed because the workaround is simple: increase
         VG_N_THREADS, rebuild and try again.)

78514   Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialized value(s)
        (a slight mishanding of FP code in memcheck)

77952   pThread Support (crash) (due to initialisation-ordering probs)
        (also 85118)

80942   Addrcheck wasn't doing overlap checking as it should.
78048   return NULL on malloc/new etc failure, instead of asserting
73655   operator new() override in user .so files often doesn't get picked up
83060   Valgrind does not handle native kernel AIO
69872   Create proper coredumps after fatal signals
82026   failure with new glibc versions: __libc_* functions are not exported
70344   UNIMPLEMENTED FUNCTION: tcdrain 
81297   Cancellation of pthread_cond_wait does not require mutex
82872   Using debug info from additional packages (wishlist)
83025   Support for ioctls FIGETBSZ and FIBMAP
83340   Support for ioctl HDIO_GET_IDENTITY
79714   Support for the semtimedop system call.
77022   Support for ioctls FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO and FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO
82098   hp2ps ansification (wishlist)
83573   Valgrind SIGSEGV on execve
82999   show which cmdline option was erroneous (wishlist)
83040   make valgrind VPATH and distcheck-clean (wishlist)
83998   Assertion `newfd > vgPlain_max_fd' failed (see below)
82722   Unchecked mmap in as_pad leads to mysterious failures later
78958   memcheck seg faults while running Mozilla 
85416   Arguments with colon (e.g. --logsocket) ignored


Additionally there are the following changes, which are not 
connected to any bug report numbers, AFAICS:

* Rearranged address space layout relative to 2.1.1, so that
  Valgrind/tools will run out of memory later than currently in many
  circumstances.  This is good news esp. for Calltree.  It should
  be possible for client programs to allocate over 800MB of
  memory when using memcheck now.

* Improved checking when laying out memory.  Should hopefully avoid
  the random segmentation faults that 2.1.1 sometimes caused.

* Support for Fedora Core 2 and SuSE 9.1.  Improvements to NPTL
  support to the extent that V now works properly on NPTL-only setups.

* Renamed the following options:
  --logfile-fd  -->  --log-fd
  --logfile     -->  --log-file
  --logsocket   -->  --log-socket
  to be consistent with each other and other options (esp. --input-fd).

* Add support for SIOCGMIIPHY, SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCSMIIREG ioctls and
  improve the checking of other interface related ioctls.

* Fix building with gcc-3.4.1.

* Remove limit on number of semaphores supported.

* Add support for syscalls: set_tid_address (258), acct (51).

* Support instruction "repne movs" -- not official but seems to occur.

* Implement an emulated soft limit for file descriptors in addition to
  the current reserved area, which effectively acts as a hard limit. The
  setrlimit system call now simply updates the emulated limits as best
  as possible - the hard limit is not allowed to move at all and just
  returns EPERM if you try and change it.  This should stop reductions
  in the soft limit causing assertions when valgrind tries to allocate
  descriptors from the reserved area.
  (This actually came from bug #83998).

* Major overhaul of Cachegrind implementation.  First user-visible change
  is that cachegrind.out files are now typically 90% smaller than they
  used to be;  code annotation times are correspondingly much smaller.
  Second user-visible change is that hit/miss counts for code that is
  unloaded at run-time is no longer dumped into a single "discard" pile,
  but accurately preserved.

* Client requests for telling valgrind about memory pools.



Developer (cvs head) release 2.1.1 (12 March 2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.1.1 contains some internal structural changes needed for V's
long-term future.  These don't affect end-users.  Most notable
user-visible changes are:

* Greater isolation between Valgrind and the program being run, so
  the program is less likely to inadvertently kill Valgrind by
  doing wild writes.

* Massif: a new space profiling tool.  Try it!  It's cool, and it'll
  tell you in detail where and when your C/C++ code is allocating heap.
  Draws pretty .ps pictures of memory use against time.  A potentially
  powerful tool for making sense of your program's space use.

* Fixes for many bugs, including support for more SSE2/SSE3 instructions,
  various signal/syscall things, and various problems with debug
  info readers.

* Support for glibc-2.3.3 based systems.

We are now doing automatic overnight build-and-test runs on a variety
of distros.  As a result, we believe 2.1.1 builds and runs on:
Red Hat 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, 9, Fedora Core 1, SuSE 8.2, SuSE 9.


The following bugs, and probably many more, have been fixed.  These
are listed at http://bugs.kde.org.  Reporting a bug for valgrind in
the http://bugs.kde.org is much more likely to get you a fix than
mailing developers directly, so please continue to keep sending bugs
there.

Unstable (cvs head) release 2.1.0 (15 December 2003)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For whatever it's worth, 2.1.0 actually seems pretty darn stable to me
(Julian).  It looks eminently usable, and given that it fixes some
significant bugs, may well be worth using on a day-to-day basis.
2.1.0 is known to build and pass regression tests on: SuSE 9, SuSE
8.2, RedHat 8.

2.1.0 most notably includes Jeremy Fitzhardinge's complete overhaul of
handling of system calls and signals, and their interaction with
threads.  In general, the accuracy of the system call, thread and
signal simulations is much improved.  Specifically:

- Blocking system calls behave exactly as they do when running
  natively (not on valgrind).  That is, if a syscall blocks only the
  calling thread when running natively, than it behaves the same on
  valgrind.  No more mysterious hangs because V doesn't know that some
  syscall or other, should block only the calling thread.

- Interrupted syscalls should now give more faithful results.

- Finally, signal contexts in signal handlers are supported.  As a
  result, konqueror on SuSE 9 no longer segfaults when notified of
  file changes in directories it is watching.

Other changes:

- Robert Walsh's file descriptor leakage checks.  When enabled,
  Valgrind will print out a list of open file descriptors on
  exit.  Along with each file descriptor, Valgrind prints out a stack
  backtrace of where the file was opened and any details relating to the
  file descriptor such as the file name or socket details.
  To use, give: --track-fds=yes

- Implemented a few more SSE/SSE2 instructions.

- Less crud on the stack when you do 'where' inside a GDB attach.

- Fixed the following bugs:
  68360: Valgrind does not compile against 2.6.0-testX kernels
  68525: CVS head doesn't compile on C90 compilers
  68566: pkgconfig support (wishlist)
  68588: Assertion `sz == 4' failed in vg_to_ucode.c (disInstr)
  69140: valgrind not able to explicitly specify a path to a binary. 
  69432: helgrind asserts encountering a MutexErr when there are 
         EraserErr suppressions

- Increase the max size of the translation cache from 200k average bbs
  to 300k average bbs.  Programs on the size of OOo (680m17) are
  thrashing the cache at the smaller size, creating large numbers of
  retranslations and wasting significant time as a result.



Stable release 2.0.0 (5 Nov 2003)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.0.0 improves SSE/SSE2 support, fixes some minor bugs, and
improves support for SuSE 9 and the Red Hat "Severn" beta.

- Further improvements to SSE/SSE2 support.  The entire test suite of
  the GNU Scientific Library (gsl-1.4) compiled with Intel Icc 7.1
  20030307Z '-g -O -xW' now works.  I think this gives pretty good
  coverage of SSE/SSE2 floating point instructions, or at least the
  subset emitted by Icc.

- Also added support for the following instructions:
    MOVNTDQ UCOMISD UNPCKLPS UNPCKHPS SQRTSS
    PUSH/POP %{FS,GS}, and PUSH %CS (Nb: there is no POP %CS).

- CFI support for GDB version 6.  Needed to enable newer GDBs
  to figure out where they are when using --gdb-attach=yes.

- Fix this:
      mc_translate.c:1091 (memcheck_instrument): Assertion
      `u_in->size == 4 || u_in->size == 16' failed.

- Return an error rather than panicing when given a bad socketcall.

- Fix checking of syscall rt_sigtimedwait().

- Implement __NR_clock_gettime (syscall 265).  Needed on Red Hat Severn.

- Fixed bug in overlap check in strncpy() -- it was assuming the src was 'n'
  bytes long, when it could be shorter, which could cause false
  positives.

- Support use of select() for very large numbers of file descriptors.

- Don't fail silently if the executable is statically linked, or is
  setuid/setgid. Print an error message instead.

- Support for old DWARF-1 format line number info.



Snapshot 20031012 (12 October 2003)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three months worth of bug fixes, roughly.  Most significant single
change is improved SSE/SSE2 support, mostly thanks to Dirk Mueller.

20031012 builds on Red Hat Fedora ("Severn") but doesn't really work
(curiosly, mozilla runs OK, but a modest "ls -l" bombs).  I hope to
get a working version out soon.  It may or may not work ok on the
forthcoming SuSE 9; I hear positive noises about it but haven't been
able to verify this myself (not until I get hold of a copy of 9).

A detailed list of changes, in no particular order:

- Describe --gen-suppressions in the FAQ.

- Syscall __NR_waitpid supported.

- Minor MMX bug fix.

- -v prints program's argv[] at startup.

- More glibc-2.3 suppressions.

- Suppressions for stack underrun bug(s) in the c++ support library
  distributed with Intel Icc 7.0.

- Fix problems reading /proc/self/maps.

- Fix a couple of messages that should have been suppressed by -q, 
  but weren't.

- Make Addrcheck understand "Overlap" suppressions.

- At startup, check if program is statically linked and bail out if so.

- Cachegrind: Auto-detect Intel Pentium-M, also VIA Nehemiah

- Memcheck/addrcheck: minor speed optimisations

- Handle syscall __NR_brk more correctly than before.

- Fixed incorrect allocate/free mismatch errors when using
  operator new(unsigned, std::nothrow_t const&)
  operator new[](unsigned, std::nothrow_t const&)

- Support POSIX pthread spinlocks.

- Fixups for clean compilation with gcc-3.3.1.

- Implemented more opcodes: 
    - push %es
    - push %ds
    - pop %es
    - pop %ds
    - movntq
    - sfence
    - pshufw
    - pavgb
    - ucomiss
    - enter
    - mov imm32, %esp
    - all "in" and "out" opcodes
    - inc/dec %esp
    - A whole bunch of SSE/SSE2 instructions

- Memcheck: don't bomb on SSE/SSE2 code.


Snapshot 20030725 (25 July 2003)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes some minor problems in 20030716.

- Fix bugs in overlap checking for strcpy/memcpy etc.

- Do overlap checking with Addrcheck as well as Memcheck.

- Fix this:
      Memcheck: the `impossible' happened:
      get_error_name: unexpected type

- Install headers needed to compile new skins.

- Remove leading spaces and colon in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH / LD_PRELOAD
  passed to non-traced children.

- Fix file descriptor leak in valgrind-listener.

- Fix longstanding bug in which the allocation point of a 
  block resized by realloc was not correctly set.  This may
  have caused confusing error messages.


Snapshot 20030716 (16 July 2003)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

20030716 is a snapshot of our current CVS head (development) branch.
This is the branch which will become valgrind-2.0.  It contains
significant enhancements over the 1.9.X branch.

Despite this being a snapshot of the CVS head, it is believed to be
quite stable -- at least as stable as 1.9.6 or 1.0.4, if not more so
-- and therefore suitable for widespread use.  Please let us know asap
if it causes problems for you.

Two reasons for releasing a snapshot now are:

- It's been a while since 1.9.6, and this snapshot fixes
  various problems that 1.9.6 has with threaded programs 
  on glibc-2.3.X based systems.

- So as to make available improvements in the 2.0 line.

Major changes in 20030716, as compared to 1.9.6:

- More fixes to threading support on glibc-2.3.1 and 2.3.2-based
  systems (SuSE 8.2, Red Hat 9).  If you have had problems
  with inconsistent/illogical behaviour of errno, h_errno or the DNS
  resolver functions in threaded programs, 20030716 should improve
  matters.  This snapshot seems stable enough to run OpenOffice.org
  1.1rc on Red Hat 7.3, SuSE 8.2 and Red Hat 9, and that's a big
  threaded app if ever I saw one.

- Automatic generation of suppression records; you no longer
  need to write them by hand.  Use --gen-suppressions=yes.

- strcpy/memcpy/etc check their arguments for overlaps, when
  running with the Memcheck or Addrcheck skins.

- malloc_usable_size() is now supported.

- new client requests:
    - VALGRIND_COUNT_ERRORS, VALGRIND_COUNT_LEAKS: 
      useful with regression testing
    - VALGRIND_NON_SIMD_CALL[0123]: for running arbitrary functions 
      on real CPU (use with caution!)

- The GDB attach mechanism is more flexible.  Allow the GDB to
  be run to be specified by --gdb-path=/path/to/gdb, and specify
  which file descriptor V will read its input from with
  --input-fd=<number>.

- Cachegrind gives more accurate results (wasn't tracking instructions in
  malloc() and friends previously, is now).

- Complete support for the MMX instruction set.

- Partial support for the SSE and SSE2 instruction sets.  Work for this
  is ongoing.  About half the SSE/SSE2 instructions are done, so
  some SSE based programs may work.  Currently you need to specify
  --skin=addrcheck.  Basically not suitable for real use yet.

- Significant speedups (10%-20%) for standard memory checking.

- Fix assertion failure in pthread_once().

- Fix this:
    valgrind: vg_intercept.c:598 (vgAllRoadsLeadToRome_select): 
              Assertion `ms_end >= ms_now' failed.

- Implement pthread_mutexattr_setpshared.

- Understand Pentium 4 branch hints.  Also implemented a couple more
  obscure x86 instructions.

- Lots of other minor bug fixes.

- We have a decent regression test system, for the first time.
  This doesn't help you directly, but it does make it a lot easier
  for us to track the quality of the system, especially across
  multiple linux distributions.  

  You can run the regression tests with 'make regtest' after 'make
  install' completes.  On SuSE 8.2 and Red Hat 9 I get this:
 
     == 84 tests, 0 stderr failures, 0 stdout failures ==

  On Red Hat 8, I get this:

     == 84 tests, 2 stderr failures, 1 stdout failure ==
     corecheck/tests/res_search               (stdout)
     memcheck/tests/sigaltstack               (stderr)

  sigaltstack is probably harmless.  res_search doesn't work
  on R H 8 even running natively, so I'm not too worried.   

  On Red Hat 7.3, a glibc-2.2.5 system, I get these harmless failures:

     == 84 tests, 2 stderr failures, 1 stdout failure ==
     corecheck/tests/pth_atfork1              (stdout)
     corecheck/tests/pth_atfork1              (stderr)
     memcheck/tests/sigaltstack               (stderr)

  You need to run on a PII system, at least, since some tests
  contain P6-specific instructions, and the test machine needs
  access to the internet so that corecheck/tests/res_search
  (a test that the DNS resolver works) can function.

As ever, thanks for the vast amount of feedback :) and bug reports :(
We may not answer all messages, but we do at least look at all of
them, and tend to fix the most frequently reported bugs.



Version 1.9.6 (7 May 2003 or thereabouts)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major changes in 1.9.6:

- Improved threading support for glibc >= 2.3.2 (SuSE 8.2,
  RedHat 9, to name but two ...)  It turned out that 1.9.5
  had problems with threading support on glibc >= 2.3.2,
  usually manifested by threaded programs deadlocking in system calls,
  or running unbelievably slowly.  Hopefully these are fixed now.  1.9.6
  is the first valgrind which gives reasonable support for
  glibc-2.3.2.  Also fixed a 2.3.2 problem with pthread_atfork().

- Majorly expanded FAQ.txt.  We've added workarounds for all
  common problems for which a workaround is known.

Minor changes in 1.9.6:

- Fix identification of the main thread's stack.  Incorrect
  identification of it was causing some on-stack addresses to not get
  identified as such.  This only affected the usefulness of some error
  messages; the correctness of the checks made is unchanged.

- Support for kernels >= 2.5.68.

- Dummy implementations of __libc_current_sigrtmin, 
  __libc_current_sigrtmax and __libc_allocate_rtsig, hopefully
  good enough to keep alive programs which previously died for lack of
  them.

- Fix bug in the VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS client request.

- Fix bug in the DWARF2 debug line info loader, when instructions 
  following each other have source lines far from each other 
  (e.g. with inlined functions).

- Debug info reading: read symbols from both "symtab" and "dynsym"
  sections, rather than merely from the one that comes last in the
  file.

- New syscall support: prctl(), creat(), lookup_dcookie().

- When checking calls to accept(), recvfrom(), getsocketopt(),
  don't complain if buffer values are NULL.

- Try and avoid assertion failures in
  mash_LD_PRELOAD_and_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

- Minor bug fixes in cg_annotate.



Version 1.9.5 (7 April 2003)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It occurs to me that it would be helpful for valgrind users to record
in the source distribution the changes in each release.  So I now
attempt to mend my errant ways :-)  Changes in this and future releases
will be documented in the NEWS file in the source distribution.

Major changes in 1.9.5:

- (Critical bug fix): Fix a bug in the FPU simulation.  This was
  causing some floating point conditional tests not to work right.
  Several people reported this.  If you had floating point code which
  didn't work right on 1.9.1 to 1.9.4, it's worth trying 1.9.5.

- Partial support for Red Hat 9.  RH9 uses the new Native Posix 
  Threads Library (NPTL), instead of the older LinuxThreads.  
  This potentially causes problems with V which will take some
  time to correct.  In the meantime we have partially worked around
  this, and so 1.9.5 works on RH9.  Threaded programs still work,
  but they may deadlock, because some system calls (accept, read,
  write, etc) which should be nonblocking, in fact do block.  This
  is a known bug which we are looking into.

  If you can, your best bet (unfortunately) is to avoid using 
  1.9.5 on a Red Hat 9 system, or on any NPTL-based distribution.
  If your glibc is 2.3.1 or earlier, you're almost certainly OK.

Minor changes in 1.9.5:

- Added some #errors to valgrind.h to ensure people don't include
  it accidentally in their sources.  This is a change from 1.0.X
  which was never properly documented.  The right thing to include
  is now memcheck.h.  Some people reported problems and strange
  behaviour when (incorrectly) including valgrind.h in code with 
  1.9.1 -- 1.9.4.  This is no longer possible.

- Add some __extension__ bits and pieces so that gcc configured
  for valgrind-checking compiles even with -Werror.  If you
  don't understand this, ignore it.  Of interest to gcc developers
  only.

- Removed a pointless check which caused problems interworking 
  with Clearcase.  V would complain about shared objects whose
  names did not end ".so", and refuse to run.  This is now fixed.
  In fact it was fixed in 1.9.4 but not documented.

- Fixed a bug causing an assertion failure of "waiters == 1"
  somewhere in vg_scheduler.c, when running large threaded apps,
  notably MySQL.

- Add support for the munlock system call (124).

Some comments about future releases:

1.9.5 is, we hope, the most stable Valgrind so far.  It pretty much
supersedes the 1.0.X branch.  If you are a valgrind packager, please
consider making 1.9.5 available to your users.  You can regard the
1.0.X branch as obsolete: 1.9.5 is stable and vastly superior.  There
are no plans at all for further releases of the 1.0.X branch.

If you want a leading-edge valgrind, consider building the cvs head
(from SourceForge), or getting a snapshot of it.  Current cool stuff
going in includes MMX support (done); SSE/SSE2 support (in progress),
a significant (10-20%) performance improvement (done), and the usual
large collection of minor changes.  Hopefully we will be able to
improve our NPTL support, but no promises.
