/* This file is used to have main_main.c compiled with VEXMULTIARCH
   defined, so that all host and guest arch are callable from LibVEX_Translate
   and other functions defined in main_main.c.
   The resulting object file will be put in libvexmultiarch-<platform>-os>.a.

   The valgrind tools are making the assumption that host and guest are
   the same. So, no need to drag the full set of archs when
   linking a tool.
   The VEX library is nicely split in arch independent and arch dependent
   objects. Only main_main.c is dragging the various arch specific files.
   So, main_main.c (the main entry point of the VEX library) is compiled
   only for the current guest/host arch.

   This file ensures we recompile main_main.c with all archs activated.
   
   So, a VEX user can decide (at link time) to use a 'single arch' VEX lib,
   or to use a multiarch VEX lib.
   If t1.o is a 'main' that calls LibVEX_Translate, then
   to link with a single arch VEX lib, use e.g. the following :
     gcc -o t1single t1.o -LInst/lib/valgrind  -lvex-amd64-linux -lgcc

   to link with a multi arch VEX lib, you must insert 
     -lvexmultiarch-amd64-linux *before* -lvex-amd64-linux
   i.e;
     gcc -o t1multi t1.o \
        -LInst/lib/valgrind -lvexmultiarch-amd64-linux -lvex-amd64-linux -lgcc

   t1single will only be able to translate from amd64 to amd64.
   t1multi will be able to translate from any arch supported by VEX
   to any other arch supported by VEX.
   Note however that multiarch support is experimental and poorly
   or not tested.
