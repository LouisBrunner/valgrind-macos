  <title>Massif: a heap profiler</title>

<emphasis>Please note that this documentation describes Massif version 3.3.0
and later.  Massif was significantly overhauled for 3.3.0;  versions 3.2.3
and earlier presented the profiling information an a quite different manner,
and so this documentation only pertains to the later versions.</emphasis>

<para>To use this tool, you must specify
<computeroutput>--tool=massif</computeroutput> on the Valgrind
command line.</para>

<sect1 id="ms-manual.spaceprof" xreflabel="Heap profiling">
<title>Heap profiling</title>

<para>Massif is a heap profiler.  It measures how much heap memory your
program uses.  This includes both the useful space, and the extra bytes
allocated for book-keeping purposes and alignment purposes.  It can also
measure the size of your program's stack(s), although it does not do so by
default.</para>

<para>Heap profiling can help you reduce the amount of memory your program
uses.  On modern machines with virtual memory, this provides the following
benefits:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>It can speed up your program -- a smaller
    program will interact better with your machine's caches and
    avoid paging.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>If your program uses lots of memory, it will
    reduce the chance that it exhausts your machine's swap
    space.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Also, there are certain space leaks that aren't detected by
traditional leak-checkers, such as Memcheck's.  That's because
the memory isn't ever actually lost -- a pointer remains to it --
but it's not in use.  Programs that have leaks like this can
unnecessarily increase the amount of memory they are using over
time.  Massif can help identify these leaks.</para>

<para>Importantly, Massif tells you not only how much heap memory your
program is using, it also gives very detailed information that indicates
which parts of your program are responsible for allocating the heap memory.
</para>

<sect1 id="ms-manual.using" xreflabel="Using Massif">
<title>Using Massif</title>


<para>First off, as for the other Valgrind tools, you should compile with
debugging info (the <computeroutput>-g</computeroutput> flag).  It shouldn't
matter much what optimisation level you compile your program with, as this
is unlikely to affect the heap memory usage.</para>

<para>Then, to gather heap profiling information about the program
<computeroutput>prog</computeroutput>, type:</para>
<screen><![CDATA[
% valgrind --tool=massif prog
]]></screen>

<para>The program will execute (slowly).  Upon completion, no summary
statistics are printed to Valgrind's commentary;  all of Massif's profiling
data is written to a file.  By default, this file is called
<filename>massif.out.&lt;pid&gt;</filename>, where
<filename>&lt;pid&gt;</filename> is the process ID.</para>

<para>To see the information gathered by Massif in an easy-to-read form, use
the ms_print script.  If the output file's name is
<filename>massif.out.12345</filename>, type:</para>
<screen><![CDATA[
% ms_print massif.out.12345]]></screen>

<para>ms_print will produce (a) a graph showing the memory consumption over
the program's execution, and (b) detailed information about the responsible
allocation sites at various points in the program, including the point of
peak memory allocation.  The use of a separate script for presenting the
results is deliberate:  it separates the data gathering from its
presentation, and means that new methods of presenting the data can be added in
the future.</para>

<sect2 id="ms-manual.anexample" xreflabel="An Example">
<title>An Example Program</title>

<para>An example will make things clear.  Consider the following C program
(annotated with line numbers) which allocates a number of different blocks
on the heap.</para>

<para>Why is most of the graph empty, with only a couple of bars at the very
end?  By default, Massif uses "instructions executed" as the unit of time.
For very short-run programs such as the example, most of the executed
instructions involve the loading and dynamic linking of the program.  The
execution of <computeroutput>main</computeroutput> (and thus the heap
allocations) only occur at the very end.  For a short-running program like
this, we can use the <computeroutput>--time-unit=B</computeroutput> option
to specify that we want the time unit to instead be the number of bytes
allocated/deallocated on the heap and stack(s).</para>

<para>If we re-run the program under Massif with this option, and then
re-run ms_print, we get this more useful graph:</para>

<para>Each vertical bar represents a snapshot, i.e. a measurement of the
memory usage at a certain point in time.  The text at the bottom show that
25 snapshots were taken for this program, which is one per heap
allocation/deallocation, plus a couple of extras.  Massif starts by taking
snapshots for every heap allocation/deallocation, but as a program runs for
longer, it takes snapshots less frequently.  It also discards older
snapshots as the program goes on;  when it reaches the maximum number of
snapshots (100 by default, although changeable with the
<computeroutput>--max-snapshots</computeroutput> option) half of them are
deleted.  This means that a reasonable number of snapshots are always
maintained.</para>

<para>Most snapshots are <emphasis>normal</emphasis>, and only basic
information is recorded for them.  Normal snapshots are represented in the
graph by bars consisting of ':' and '.' characters.</para>

<para>Some snapshots are <emphasis>detailed</emphasis>.  Information about
where allocations happened are recorded for these snapshots, as we will see
shortly.  Detailed snapshots are represented in the graph by bars consisting
of '@' and ',' characters.  The text at the bottom show that 3 detailed
snapshots were taken for this program (snapshots 9, 14 and 24).  By default,
every 10th snapshot is detailed, although this can be changed via the
<computeroutput>--detailed-freq</computeroutput> option.</para>

<para>Finally, there is at most one <emphasis>peak</emphasis> snapshot.  The
peak snapshot is a detailed snapshot, and records the point where memory
consumption was greatest.  The peak snapshot is represented in the graph by
a bar consisting of '#' and ',' characters.  The text at the bottom shows
that snapshot 14 was the peak.  Note that for tiny programs that never
deallocate heap memory, Massif will not record a peak snapshot.</para>

<para>Some more details about the peak:  the peak is determined by looking
at every allocation, i.e. it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> just the peak among
the regular snapshots.  However, recording the true peak is expensive, and
so by default Massif records a peak whose size is within 1% of the size of
the true peak.  See the description of the
<computeroutput>--peak-inaccuracy</computeroutput> option below for more
details.</para>

  <listitem><para>Its number.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The time it was taken. In this case, the time unit is

  <listitem><para>The number of useful heap bytes allocated at that point.
  This reflects the number of bytes asked for by the
  program.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The number of extra heap bytes allocated at that point.
  This reflects the number of bytes allocated in excess of what the program
  asked for.  There are two sources of extra heap bytes.</para>
  
  <para>First, every heap block has administrative bytes associated with it.
  The exact number of administrative bytes depends on the details of the
  allocator.  By default Massif assumes 8 bytes per block, as can be seen
  from the example, but this number can be changed via the
  <computeroutput>--heap-admin</computeroutput> option.</para>

  <para>Second, allocators often round up the number of bytes asked for to a
  larger number.  By default, if N bytes are asked for, Massif rounds N up
  to the nearest multiple of 8 that is equal to or greater than N.  This is
  typical behaviour for allocators, and is required to ensure that elements
  within the block are suitably aligned.  The rounding size can be changed
  with the <computeroutput>--alignment</computeroutput> option, although it
  cannot be less than 8, and must be a power of two.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The size of the stack(s).  By default, stack profiling is
  off as it slows Massif down greatly.  Therefore, the stack column is zero
  in the example.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The next snapshot is detailed.  As well as the basic counts, it gives
an allocation tree which indicates exactly which pieces of code were
responsible for allocating heap memory:</para>

<screen><![CDATA[
  9          9,072            9,072            9,000            72            0
99.21% (9,000B) (heap allocation functions) malloc/new/new[], --alloc-fns, etc.
->99.21% (9,000B) 0x804841A: main (example.c:20)
]]></screen>

<para>The allocation tree can be read from the top down.  The first line
indicates all heap allocation functions such as <function>malloc</function>
and C++ <function>new</function>.  All heap allocations go through these
functions, and so all 9,000 useful bytes (which is 99.21% of all allocated
bytes) go through them.  But how were <function>malloc</function> and new
called?  At this point, every allocation so far has been due to line 21
inside <function>main</function>, hence the second line in the tree.  The
<computeroutput>-></computeroutput> indicates that main (line 20) called
<function>malloc</function>.</para>

<para>Let's see what the subsequent output shows happened next:</para>

]]></screen>

<para>The first four snapshots are similar to the previous ones.  But then
the global allocation peak is reached, and a detailed snapshot is taken.
Its allocation tree shows that 20,000B of useful heap memory has been
allocated, and the lines and arrows indicate that this is from three
different code locations: line 20, which is responsible for 10,000B
(49.74%);  line 5, which is responsible for 8,000B (39.79%); and line 10,
which is responsible for 2,000B (9.95%).</para>

<para>We can then drill down further in the allocation tree.  For example,
of the 8,000B asked for by line 5, half of it was due to a call from line
11, and half was due to a call from line 25.</para>

<para>In short, Massif collates the stack trace of every single allocation
point in the program into a single tree, which gives a complete picture of
how and why all heap memory was allocated.</para>

<para>Note that the tree entries correspond not to functions, but to
individual code locations.  For example, if function <function>A</function>
calls <function>malloc</function>, and function <function>B</function> calls
<function>A</function> twice, once on line 10 and once on line 11, then
the two calls will result in two distinct stack traces in the tree.  In
contrast, if <function>B</function> calls <function>A</function> repeatedly
from line 15 (e.g. due to a loop), then each of those calls will be
represented by the same stack trace in the tree.</para>

<para>Note also that tree entry with children in the example satisfies an
invariant: the entry's size is equal to the sum of its children's sizes.
For example, the first entry has size 20,000B, and its children have sizes
10,000B, 8,000B, and 2,000B.  In general, this invariant almost always
holds.  However, in rare circumstances stack traces can be malformed, in
which case a stack trace can be a sub-trace of another stack trace.  This
means that some entries in the tree may not satisfy the invariant -- the
entry's size will be greater than the sum of its children's sizes.  Massif
can sometimes detect when this happens;  if it does, it issues a
warning:</para>

<screen><![CDATA[
Warning: Malformed stack trace detected.  In Massif's output,
         the size of an entry's child entries may not sum up
         to the entry's size as they normally do.
]]></screen>

<para>However, Massif does not detect and warn about every such occurrence.
Fortunately, malformed stack traces are rare in practice.</para>

<para>Returning now to ms_print's output, the final part is similar:</para>

<para>The final detailed snapshot shows how the heap looked at termination.
The 00.00% entry represents the code locations for which memory was
allocated and then freed (line 20 in this case, the memory for which was
freed on line 28).  However, no code location details are given for this
entry;  by default, Massif only records the details for code locations
responsible for more than 1% of useful memory bytes, and ms_print likewise
only prints the details for code locations responsible for more than 1%.
The entries that do not meet this threshold are aggregated.  This avoids
filling up the output with large numbers of unimportant entries.  The
thresholds can be changed with the
<computeroutput>--threshold</computeroutput> option that both Massif and
ms_print support.</para>
