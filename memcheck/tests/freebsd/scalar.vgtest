# Remove all frames from the stack trace except the first one.
# This is important because syscall() function on x86 isn't ABI conformant
# which confuses the Valgrind stack unwinder.
# Therefore x86 and amd64 stack traces are unified so that they contain only
# 'syscall (in libc)' stack frame and this is then filtered out completely.
