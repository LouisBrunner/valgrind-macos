   sending thread.  For a weak send, the sender's VC is joined into
   that already in the SO, if any.  This subtlety is needed to model
   rwlocks: a strong send corresponds to releasing a rwlock that had
   been w-held (or releasing a standard mutex).  A weak send
   corresponds to releasing a rwlock that has been r-held.

   (rationale): Since in general many threads may hold a rwlock in
   r-mode, a weak send facility is necessary in order that the final
   SO reflects the join of the VCs of all the threads releasing the
   rwlock, rather than merely holding the VC of the most recent thread

   subtlety is required in order to support reader-writer locks: a
   thread doing a write-acquire of a rwlock (or acquiring a normal
   mutex) models this by doing a strong receive.  A thread doing a
