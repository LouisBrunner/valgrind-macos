// MACH_DSC_END represent a guess to where the dyld shared cache ends
// there is no way to know for sure and even if we could,
// it would be a pain to carry that value around all of V
// so we just use a guess and hope for the best.
// Why is this value needed?
//  We only use it in a single context: when reading the dyld shared cache directly from memory
//  we use it as a bound when reading symbols with DebugInfo.
// How is this value calculated?
//  - amd64: end of user addressable space, which makes sense as the DSC is mapped at the end of the address space
//  - x86: end of user addressable space, note that there should not be any x86 valgrind with DSC support so this is just a placeholder
//  - arm64:
//    - the DSC is mapped at 0x180000000 + some ASLR slider
//    - the size depends on the macOS version but is usually less than 0xFFFFFFFF
//    - thus it should be around 0x280000000 but I have seen it reach above
//    - thus we use 0x300000000 which is also where we tell V that client memory starts
