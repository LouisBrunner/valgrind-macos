/* Note about ThreadInfo tid and tnr in various parts of _Addrinfo:
   A tid is an index in the VG_(threads)[] array. The entries
   in  VG_(threads) array are re-used, so the tid in an 'old' _Addrinfo
   might be misleading: if the thread that was using tid has been terminated
   and the tid was re-used by another thread, the tid will very probably
   be wrongly interpreted by the user.
   So, such an _Addrinfo should be printed just after it has been produced,
   before the tid could possibly be re-used by another thread.

   A tool such as helgrind is uniquely/unambiguously identifying each thread
   by a number. If the tool sets tnr between the call to
   VG_(describe_addr) and the call to VG_(pp_addrinfo), then VG_(pp_addrinfo)
   will by preference print tnr instead of tid.
   Visually, a tid will be printed as   thread %d
   while a tnr will be printed as       thread #%d
