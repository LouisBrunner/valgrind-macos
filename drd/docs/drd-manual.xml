<para>
DRD is a Valgrind tool for detecting errors in multithreaded C and C++
programs. The tool works for any program that uses the POSIX threading
primitives or that uses threading concepts built on top of the POSIX threading
primitives.

<title>Multithreaded Programming Paradigms</title>

<para>
There are two possible reasons for using multithreading in a program:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      To model concurrent activities. Assigning one thread to each activity
      can be a great simplification compared to multiplexing the states of
      multiple activities in a single thread. This is why most server software
      and embedded software is multithreaded.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      To use multiple CPU cores simultaneously for speeding up
      computations. This is why many High Performance Computing (HPC)
      applications are multithreaded.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Multithreaded programs can use one or more of the following programming
paradigms. Which paradigm is appropriate depends e.g. on the application type.
Some examples of multithreaded programming paradigms are:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Locking. Data that is shared over threads is protected from concurrent
      accesses via locking. E.g. the POSIX threads library, the Qt library
      and the Boost.Thread library support this paradigm directly.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Message passing. No data is shared between threads, but threads exchange
      data by passing messages to each other. Examples of implementations of
      the message passing paradigm are MPI and CORBA.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Automatic parallelization. A compiler converts a sequential program into
      a multithreaded program. The original program may or may not contain
      parallelization hints. One example of such parallelization hints is the
      OpenMP standard. In this standard a set of directives are defined which
      tell a compiler how to parallelize a C, C++ or Fortran program. OpenMP
      is well suited for computational intensive applications. As an example,
      an open source image processing software package is using OpenMP to
      maximize performance on systems with multiple CPU
      cores. GCC supports the
      OpenMP standard from version 4.2.0 on.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Software Transactional Memory (STM). Any data that is shared between
      threads is updated via transactions. After each transaction it is
      verified whether there were any conflicting transactions. If there were
      conflicts, the transaction is aborted, otherwise it is committed. This
      is a so-called optimistic approach. There is a prototype of the Intel C++
      Compiler available that supports STM. Research about the addition of
      STM support to GCC is ongoing.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
DRD supports any combination of multithreaded programming paradigms as
long as the implementation of these paradigms is based on the POSIX
threads primitives. DRD however does not support programs that use
e.g. Linux' futexes directly. Attempts to analyze such programs with
DRD will cause DRD to report many false positives.

    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Atomic store and load-modify-store operations. While these are

<sect2 id="drd-manual.mt-problems" xreflabel="MT-Problems">
<title>Multithreaded Programming Problems</title>

<para>
Depending on which multithreading paradigm is being used in a program,
one or more of the following problems can occur:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Data races. One or more threads access the same memory location without
      sufficient locking. Most but not all data races are programming errors
      and are the cause of subtle and hard-to-find bugs.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Lock contention. One thread blocks the progress of one or more other
      threads by holding a lock too long.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Improper use of the POSIX threads API. Most implementations of the POSIX
      threads API have been optimized for runtime speed. Such implementations
      will not complain on certain errors, e.g. when a mutex is being unlocked
      by another thread than the thread that obtained a lock on the mutex.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Deadlock. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads wait for
      each other indefinitely.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      False sharing. If threads that run on different processor cores
      access different variables located in the same cache line
      frequently, this will slow down the involved threads a lot due
      to frequent exchange of cache lines.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Although the likelihood of the occurrence of data races can be reduced
through a disciplined programming style, a tool for automatic
detection of data races is a necessity when developing multithreaded
software. DRD can detect these, as well as lock contention and
improper use of the POSIX threads API.

<sect2 id="drd-manual.data-race-detection" xreflabel="data-race-detection">
<title>Data Race Detection</title>

<para>
The result of load and store operations performed by a multithreaded program
depends on the order in which memory operations are performed. This order is
determined by:
<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      All memory operations performed by the same thread are performed in
      <emphasis>program order</emphasis>, that is, the order determined by the
      program source code and the results of previous load operations.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Synchronization operations determine certain ordering constraints on
      memory operations performed by different threads. These ordering
      constraints are called the <emphasis>synchronization order</emphasis>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>
The combination of program order and synchronization order is called the
<emphasis>happens-before relationship</emphasis>. This concept was first
defined by S. Adve et al in the paper <emphasis>Detecting data races on weak
memory systems</emphasis>, ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, v.19 n.3,
p.234-243, May 1991.
</para>

<para>
Two memory operations <emphasis>conflict</emphasis> if both operations are
performed by different threads, refer to the same memory location and at least
one of them is a store operation.
</para>

<para>
A multithreaded program is <emphasis>data-race free</emphasis> if all
conflicting memory accesses are ordered by synchronization
operations.
</para>

<para>
A well known way to ensure that a multithreaded program is data-race
free is to ensure that a locking discipline is followed. It is e.g.
possible to associate a mutex with each shared data item, and to hold
a lock on the associated mutex while the shared data is accessed.
</para>

<para>
All programs that follow a locking discipline are data-race free, but not all
data-race free programs follow a locking discipline. There exist multithreaded
programs where access to shared data is arbitrated via condition variables,
semaphores or barriers. As an example, a certain class of HPC applications
consists of a sequence of computation steps separated in time by barriers, and
where these barriers are the only means of synchronization. Although there are
many conflicting memory accesses in such applications and although such
applications do not make use mutexes, most of these applications do not
contain data races.
</para>

<para>
There exist two different approaches for verifying the correctness of
multithreaded programs at runtime. The approach of the so-called Eraser
algorithm is to verify whether all shared memory accesses follow a consistent
locking strategy. And the happens-before data race detectors verify directly
whether all interthread memory accesses are ordered by synchronization
operations. While the last approach is more complex to implement, and while it
is more sensitive to OS scheduling, it is a general approach that works for
all classes of multithreaded programs. An important advantage of
happens-before data race detectors is that these do not report any false
positives.
</para>

<para>
DRD is based on the happens-before algorithm.

      <para>
        Controls whether all activities during thread creation should be
        ignored. By default enabled only on Solaris.
        Solaris provides higher throughput, parallelism and scalability than
        other operating systems, at the cost of more fine-grained locking
        activity. This means for example that when a thread is created under
        glibc, just one big lock is used for all thread setup. Solaris libc
        uses several fine-grained locks and the creator thread resumes its
        activities as soon as possible, leaving for example stack and TLS setup
        sequence to the created thread.
        This situation confuses DRD as it assumes there is some false ordering
        in place between creator and created thread; and therefore many types
        of race conditions in the application would not be reported. To prevent
        such false ordering, this command line option is set to
        <computeroutput>yes</computeroutput> by default on Solaris.

      The term <emphasis>segment</emphasis> refers to a consecutive
      sequence of load, store and synchronization operations, all
      issued by the same thread. A segment always starts and ends at a
      synchronization operation. Data race analysis is performed
      between segments instead of between individual load and store
      operations because of performance reasons.

    <para>
      There are always at least two memory accesses involved in a data
      race. Memory accesses involved in a data race are called
      <emphasis>conflicting memory accesses</emphasis>. DRD prints a
      report for each memory access that conflicts with a past memory
      access.

<para>
The above report has the following meaning:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The number in the column on the left is the process ID of the
      process being analyzed by DRD.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The first line ("Thread 3") tells you the thread ID for
      the thread in which context the data race has been detected.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The next line tells which kind of operation was performed (load or
      store) and by which thread. On the same line the start address and the
      number of bytes involved in the conflicting access are also displayed.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Next, the call stack of the conflicting access is displayed. If
      your program has been compiled with debug information
      (<option>-g</option>), this call stack will include file names and
      line numbers. The two
      bottommost frames in this call stack (<function>clone</function>
      and <function>start_thread</function>) show how the NPTL starts
      a thread. The third frame
      (<function>vg_thread_wrapper</function>) is added by DRD. The
      fourth frame (<function>thread_func</function>) is the first
      interesting line because it shows the thread entry point, that
      is the function that has been passed as the third argument to
      <function>pthread_create</function>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Next, the allocation context for the conflicting address is
      displayed. For dynamically allocated data the allocation call
      stack is shown. For static variables and stack variables the
      allocation context is only shown when the option
      <option>--read-var-info=yes</option> has been
      specified. Otherwise DRD will print <computeroutput>Allocation
      context: unknown</computeroutput>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      A conflicting access involves at least two memory accesses. For
      one of these accesses an exact call stack is displayed, and for
      the other accesses an approximate call stack is displayed,
      namely the start and the end of the segments of the other
      accesses. This information can be interpreted as follows:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Start at the bottom of both call stacks, and count the
            number stack frames with identical function name, file
            name and line number. In the above example the three
            bottommost frames are identical
            (<function>clone</function>,
            <function>start_thread</function> and
            <function>vg_thread_wrapper</function>).
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The next higher stack frame in both call stacks now tells
            you between in which source code region the other memory
            access happened. The above output tells that the other
            memory access involved in the data race happened between
            source code lines 28 and 30 in file
            <computeroutput>rwlock_race.c</computeroutput>.

<title>Detected Errors: Lock Contention</title>

<para>
Threads must be able to make progress without being blocked for too long by
other threads. Sometimes a thread has to wait until a mutex or reader-writer
synchronization object is unlocked by another thread. This is called
<emphasis>lock contention</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Lock contention causes delays. Such delays should be as short as
possible. The two command line options
<literal>--exclusive-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</literal> and
<literal>--shared-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</literal> make it possible to
detect excessive lock contention by making DRD report any lock that
has been held longer than the specified threshold. An example:

<title>Client Requests</title>

<para>
Just as for other Valgrind tools it is possible to let a client program
interact with the DRD tool through client requests. In addition to the
client requests several macros have been defined that allow to use the
client requests in a convenient way.
</para>

<para>
The interface between client programs and the DRD tool is defined in
the header file <literal>&lt;valgrind/drd.h&gt;</literal>. The
available macros and client requests are:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The macro <literal>DRD_GET_VALGRIND_THREADID</literal> and the
      corresponding client
      request <varname>VG_USERREQ__DRD_GET_VALGRIND_THREAD_ID</varname>.
      Query the thread ID that has been assigned by the Valgrind core to the
      thread executing this client request. Valgrind's thread ID's start at
      one and are recycled in case a thread stops.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The macro <literal>DRD_GET_DRD_THREADID</literal> and the corresponding
      client request <varname>VG_USERREQ__DRD_GET_DRD_THREAD_ID</varname>.
      Query the thread ID that has been assigned by DRD to the thread
      executing this client request. These are the thread ID's reported by DRD
      in data race reports and in trace messages. DRD's thread ID's start at
      one and are never recycled.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The macros <literal>DRD_IGNORE_VAR(x)</literal>,
      <literal>ANNOTATE_TRACE_MEMORY(&amp;x)</literal> and the corresponding
      client request <varname>VG_USERREQ__DRD_START_SUPPRESSION</varname>. Some
      applications contain intentional races. There exist e.g. applications
      where the same value is assigned to a shared variable from two different
      threads. It may be more convenient to suppress such races than to solve
      these. This client request allows one to suppress such races.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      The macro <literal>DRD_STOP_IGNORING_VAR(x)</literal> and the

      race on a specified variable, and it's not immediately clear which
      source code statements triggered the conflicting accesses, it can be
      very helpful to trace all activity on the offending memory location.

<sect2 id="drd-manual.openmp" xreflabel="OpenMP">
<title>Debugging OpenMP Programs</title>

<para>
OpenMP stands for <emphasis>Open Multi-Processing</emphasis>. The OpenMP
standard consists of a set of compiler directives for C, C++ and Fortran
programs that allows a compiler to transform a sequential program into a
parallel program. OpenMP is well suited for HPC applications and allows one to
work at a higher level compared to direct use of the POSIX threads API. While
OpenMP ensures that the POSIX API is used correctly, OpenMP programs can still
contain data races. So it definitely makes sense to verify OpenMP programs
with a thread checking tool.
</para>

<para>
DRD supports OpenMP shared-memory programs generated by GCC. GCC
supports OpenMP since version 4.2.0.  GCC's runtime support
for OpenMP programs is provided by a library called
<literal>libgomp</literal>. The synchronization primitives implemented
in this library use Linux' futex system call directly, unless the
library has been configured with the
<literal>--disable-linux-futex</literal> option. DRD only supports
libgomp libraries that have been configured with this option and in
which symbol information is present. For most Linux distributions this
means that you will have to recompile GCC. See also the script
<literal>drd/scripts/download-and-build-gcc</literal> in the
Valgrind source tree for an example of how to compile GCC. You will
also have to make sure that the newly compiled
<literal>libgomp.so</literal> library is loaded when OpenMP programs
are started. This is possible by adding a line similar to the
following to your shell startup script:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/gcc-4.4.0/lib64:~/gcc-4.4.0/lib:
]]></programlisting>

<para>
As an example, the test OpenMP test program
<literal>drd/tests/omp_matinv</literal> triggers a data race
when the option -r has been specified on the command line. The data
race is triggered by the following code:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
#pragma omp parallel for private(j)
for (j = 0; j < rows; j++)
{
  if (i != j)
  {
    const elem_t factor = a[j * cols + i];
    for (k = 0; k < cols; k++)
    {
      a[j * cols + k] -= a[i * cols + k] * factor;
    }
  }
}
]]></programlisting>

<para>
The above code is racy because the variable <literal>k</literal> has
not been declared private. DRD will print the following error message
for the above code:
</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[

</para>

<para>
Note: for GCC versions before 4.4.0, no allocation context information is
shown. With these GCC versions the most usable information in the above output
is the source file name and the line number where the data race has been
detected (<literal>omp_matinv.c:203</literal>).

<sect2 id="drd-manual.cust-mem-alloc" xreflabel="Custom Memory Allocators">
<title>DRD and Custom Memory Allocators</title>

<para>
DRD tracks all memory allocation events that happen via the
standard memory allocation and deallocation functions
(<function>malloc</function>, <function>free</function>,
<function>new</function> and <function>delete</function>), via entry
and exit of stack frames or that have been annotated with Valgrind's
memory pool client requests. DRD uses memory allocation and deallocation
information for two purposes:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      To know where the scope ends of POSIX objects that have not been
      destroyed explicitly. It is e.g. not required by the POSIX
      threads standard to call
      <function>pthread_mutex_destroy</function> before freeing the
      memory in which a mutex object resides.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      To know where the scope of variables ends. If e.g. heap memory
      has been used by one thread, that thread frees that memory, and
      another thread allocates and starts using that memory, no data
      races must be reported for that memory.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
It is essential for correct operation of DRD that the tool knows about
memory allocation and deallocation events. When analyzing a client program
with DRD that uses a custom memory allocator, either instrument the custom
memory allocator with the <literal>VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK</literal>
and <literal>VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK</literal> macros or disable the
custom memory allocator.
</para>

<para>
As an example, the GNU libstdc++ library can be configured
to use standard memory allocation functions instead of memory pools by
setting the environment variable
<literal>GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW</literal>. For more information, see also

<sect2 id="drd-manual.drd-versus-memcheck" xreflabel="DRD Versus Memcheck">
<title>DRD Versus Memcheck</title>

<para>
It is essential for correct operation of DRD that there are no memory
errors such as dangling pointers in the client program. Which means that
it is a good idea to make sure that your program is Memcheck-clean
before you analyze it with DRD. It is possible however that some of
the Memcheck reports are caused by data races. In this case it makes
sense to run DRD before Memcheck.
</para>

<para>
So which tool should be run first? In case both DRD and Memcheck
complain about a program, a possible approach is to run both tools
alternatingly and to fix as many errors as possible after each run of
each tool until none of the two tools prints any more error messages.

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      When running a program under DRD with default DRD options,
      between 1.1 and 3.6 times more memory will be needed compared to

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Make sure that debug information is present in the executable

      number information in stack traces. Most compilers can be told
      to include debug information via compiler option
      <option>-g</option>.

    <para>
      Compile with option <option>-O1</option> instead of

In complex applications it is not always clear from beforehand which
mutex will be locked recursively and which mutex will not be locked
recursively. Attempts lock a non-recursive mutex recursively will
result in race conditions that are very hard to find without a thread
checking tool. So either use the error checking mutex type and
consistently check the return value of Pthread API mutex calls, or use
the recursive mutex type.

<title>Condition variables</title>

<para>
A condition variable allows one thread to wake up one or more other
threads. Condition variables are often used to notify one or more
threads about state changes of shared data. Unfortunately it is very
easy to introduce race conditions by using condition variables as the
only means of state information propagation. A better approach is to
let threads poll for changes of a state variable that is protected by
a mutex, and to use condition variables only as a thread wakeup
mechanism. See also the source file
<computeroutput>drd/tests/monitor_example.cpp</computeroutput> for an
example of how to implement this concept in C++. The monitor concept
