//--------------------------------------------------------------------
// PURPOSE: an XTree is conceptually a set of stacktraces organised
// as a tree structure. 
// A stacktrace (an Addr* ips, i.e. an array of IPs : Instruction Pointers)
// can be added to the tree once transformed into an execontext (ec).
// Some data (typically one or more integer values) can be attached to
// leafs of the tree.
// Non-leaf nodes data is build by combining (typically adding together)
// the data of their children nodes.
// An XTree can be output in various formats.
//
//--------------------------------------------------------------------


/* It's an abstract type. */

/* 3 functions types used by an xtree to manipulate the data attached to leafs
   of an XTree.
   XT_init_data_t function is used to initialise (typically to 0) the data
   of a new node.
   XT_add_data_t function is used to add 'value' to the data 'to'.
   XT_sub_data_t function is used to substract 'value' from the data 'from'.

   Note that the add/sub functions can do whatever operations to
   combine/integrate value with/into to or from. In other words, add/sub
   functions are in fact equivalent to 'Reduce' functions. Add/sub is used
   as it is assumed that this module will be mostly used to follow
   resource consumption, which can be more clearly modelled with add/sub.
   For such resource consumption usage, typically, a call to add means that
   some additional resource has been allocated or consumed or ... by the
   given ExeContext. Similarly, a call to sub means that some resource
   has been released/freed/... by the given execontext.

   Note however that there is no constraints in what add (or sub) can do. For
   example, the add function could maintain Min/Max values, or an histogram of
   values, or ... */

   the bottom of the ec Stacktrace : *top is the offset of the first IP to take
   into account. *n_ips_sel is the nr of IPs selected starting from *top.

   If XT_filter_IPs_t gives *n_ips_sel equal to 0, then the inserted ec will
   be fully ignored when outputting the xtree: 
     the ec value(s) will not be counted in the XTree total,
     the ec will not be printed/shown.
