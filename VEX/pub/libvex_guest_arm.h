      /* Representation of the Thumb IT state.  ITSTATE is a 32-bit
         value with 4 8-bit lanes.  [7:0] pertain to the next insn to
         execute, [15:8] for the one after that, etc.  The per-insn
         update to ITSTATE is to unsignedly shift it right 8 bits,
         hence introducing a zero byte for the furthest ahead
         instruction.  As per the next para, a zero byte denotes the
         condition ALWAYS.

         Each byte lane has one of the two following formats:

         cccc 0001  for an insn which is part of an IT block.  cccc is
                    the guarding condition (standard ARM condition
                    code) XORd with 0xE, so as to cause 'cccc == 0'
                    to encode the condition ALWAYS.

         0000 0000  for an insn which is not part of an IT block.

         If the bottom 4 bits are zero then the top 4 must be too.

         Given the byte lane for an instruction, the guarding
         condition for the instruction is (((lane >> 4) & 0xF) ^ 0xE).
         This is not as stupid as it sounds, because the front end
         elides the shift.  And the am-I-in-an-IT-block check is
         (lane != 0).

         In the case where (by whatever means) we know at JIT time
         that an instruction is not in an IT block, we can prefix its
         IR with assignments ITSTATE = 0 and hence have iropt fold out
         the testing code.

         The condition "is outside or last in IT block" corresponds
         to the top 24 bits of ITSTATE being zero.
