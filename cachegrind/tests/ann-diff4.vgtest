# The `sleep` is to ensure the mtime of the second touched file is greater than
# the mtime of the first touched file.
#
# Because only one of the two x.rs files is newer than the cgout files, we don't
# get an mtime warning on x.rs. But both w.rs files are new than the cgout
# files, so we do get an mtime warning on w.rs.
