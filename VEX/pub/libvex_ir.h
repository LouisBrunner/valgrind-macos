/*--- High-level IR description                               ---*/
/*---------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* Vex IR is an architecture-neutral intermediate representation.
   Unlike some IRs in systems similar to Vex, it is not like assembly
   language (ie. a list of instructions).  Rather, it is more like the
   IR that might be used in a compiler.

   Code blocks
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   The code is broken into small code blocks ("superblocks", type:
   'IRSB').  Each code block typically represents from 1 to perhaps 50
   instructions.  IRSBs are single-entry, multiple-exit code blocks.
   Each IRSB contains three things:
   - a type environment, which indicates the type of each temporary
     value present in the IRSB
   - a list of statements, which represent code
   - a jump that exits from the end the IRSB
   Because the blocks are multiple-exit, there can be additional
   conditional exit statements that cause control to leave the IRSB
   before the final exit.  Also because of this, IRSBs can cover
   multiple non-consecutive sequences of code (up to 3).  These are
   recorded in the type VexGuestExtents (see libvex.h).

   Statements and expressions
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Statements (type 'IRStmt') represent operations with side-effects,
   eg.  guest register writes, stores, and assignments to temporaries.
   Expressions (type 'IRExpr') represent operations without
   side-effects, eg. arithmetic operations, loads, constants.
   Expressions can contain sub-expressions, forming expression trees,
   eg. (3 + (4 * load(addr1)).

   Storage of guest state
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The "guest state" contains the guest registers of the guest machine
   (ie.  the machine that we are simulating).  It is stored by default
   in a block of memory supplied by the user of the VEX library,
   generally referred to as the guest state (area).  To operate on
   these registers, one must first read ("Get") them from the guest
   state into a temporary value.  Afterwards, one can write ("Put")
   them back into the guest state.

   Get and Put are characterised by a byte offset into the guest
   state, a small integer which effectively gives the identity of the
   referenced guest register, and a type, which indicates the size of
   the value to be transferred.

   The basic "Get" and "Put" operations are sufficient to model normal
   fixed registers on the guest.  Selected areas of the guest state
   can be treated as a circular array of registers (type:
   'IRRegArray'), which can be indexed at run-time.  This is done with
   the "GetI" and "PutI" primitives.  This is necessary to describe
   rotating register files, for example the x87 FPU stack, SPARC
   register windows, and the Itanium register files.

   Examples, and flattened vs. unflattened code
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   For example, consider this x86 instruction:
     
     addl %eax, %ebx

   One Vex IR translation for this code would be this:

     ------ IMark(0x24F275, 7, 0) ------
     t3 = GET:I32(0)             # get %eax, a 32-bit integer
     t2 = GET:I32(12)            # get %ebx, a 32-bit integer
     t1 = Add32(t3,t2)           # addl
     PUT(0) = t1                 # put %eax

   (For simplicity, this ignores the effects on the condition codes, and
   the update of the instruction pointer.)

   The "IMark" is an IR statement that doesn't represent actual code.
   Instead it indicates the address and length of the original
   instruction.  The numbers 0 and 12 are offsets into the guest state
   for %eax and %ebx.  The full list of offsets for an architecture
   <ARCH> can be found in the type VexGuest<ARCH>State in the file
   VEX/pub/libvex_guest_<ARCH>.h.

   The five statements in this example are:
   - the IMark
   - three assignments to temporaries
   - one register write (put)

   The six expressions in this example are:
   - two register reads (gets)
   - one arithmetic (add) operation
   - three temporaries (two nested within the Add32, one in the PUT)

   The above IR is "flattened", ie. all sub-expressions are "atoms",
   either constants or temporaries.  An equivalent, unflattened version
   would be:
   
     PUT(0) = Add32(GET:I32(0), GET:I32(12))

   IR is guaranteed to be flattened at instrumentation-time.  This makes
   instrumentation easier.  Equivalent flattened and unflattened IR
   typically results in the same generated code.

   Another example, this one showing loads and stores:

     addl %edx,4(%eax)

   This becomes (again ignoring condition code and instruction pointer
   updates):

     ------ IMark(0x4000ABA, 3, 0) ------
     t3 = Add32(GET:I32(0),0x4:I32)
     t2 = LDle:I32(t3)
     t1 = GET:I32(8)
     t0 = Add32(t2,t1)
     STle(t3) = t0

   The "le" in "LDle" and "STle" is short for "little-endian".

   No need for deallocations
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Although there are allocation functions for various data structures
   in this file, there are no deallocation functions.  This is because
   Vex uses a memory allocation scheme that automatically reclaims the
   memory used by allocated structures once translation is completed.
   This makes things easier for tools that instruments/transforms code
   blocks.

   SSAness and typing
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The IR is fully typed.  For every IRSB (IR block) it is possible to
   say unambiguously whether or not it is correctly typed.
   Incorrectly typed IR has no meaning and the VEX will refuse to
   process it.  At various points during processing VEX typechecks the
   IR and aborts if any violations are found.  This seems overkill but
   makes it a great deal easier to build a reliable JIT.

   IR also has the SSA property.  SSA stands for Static Single
   Assignment, and what it means is that each IR temporary may be
   assigned to only once.  This idea became widely used in compiler
   construction in the mid to late 90s.  It makes many IR-level
   transformations/code improvements easier, simpler and faster.
   Whenever it typechecks an IR block, VEX also checks the SSA
   property holds, and will abort if not so.  So SSAness is
   mechanically and rigidly enforced.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------*/

/* General comments about naming schemes:

   All publically visible functions contain the name of the primary
   type on which they operate (IRFoo, IRBar, etc).  Hence you should
   be able to identify these functions by grepping for "IR[A-Z]".

   For some type 'IRFoo':

   - ppIRFoo is the printing method for IRFoo, printing it to the
     output channel specified in the LibVEX_Initialise call.

   - eqIRFoo is a structural equality predicate for IRFoos.

   - deepCopyIRFoo is a deep copy constructor for IRFoos. 
     It recursively traverses the entire argument tree and
     produces a complete new tree.  All types have a deep copy
     constructor.

   - shallowCopyIRFoo is the shallow copy constructor for IRFoos.
     It creates a new top-level copy of the supplied object,
     but does not copy any sub-objects.  Only some types have a
     shallow copy constructor.

            01b  to -infinity
            10b  to +infinity
            11b  to zero
         This just happens to be the Intel encoding.  For reference only,
         the PPC encoding is:
            00b  to nearest (the default)
            01b  to zero
            10b  to +infinity
            11b  to -infinity
         Any PPC -> IR front end will have to translate these PPC
         encodings, as encoded in the guest state, to the standard
         encodings, to pass to the primops.
         For reference only, the ARM VFP encoding is:
            00b  to nearest
            01b  to +infinity
            10b  to -infinity
            11b  to zero
         Again, this will have to be converted to the standard encoding
         to pass to primops.

         If one of these conversions gets an out-of-range condition,
         or a NaN, as an argument, the result is host-defined.  On x86
         the "integer indefinite" value 0x80..00 is produced.  On PPC
         it is either 0x80..00 or 0x7F..FF depending on the sign of
         the argument.

         On ARMvfp, when converting to a signed integer result, the
         overflow result is 0x80..00 for negative args and 0x7F..FF
         for positive args.  For unsigned integer results it is
         0x00..00 and 0xFF..FF respectively.

         Rounding is required whenever the destination type cannot
         represent exactly all values of the source type.

      /* Read a guest register at a non-fixed offset in the guest
         state.  This allows circular indexing into parts of the guest
         state, which is essential for modelling situations where the
         identity of guest registers is not known until run time.  One
         example is the x87 FP register stack.

         The part of the guest state to be treated as a circular array
         is described in the IRRegArray 'descr' field.  It holds the
         offset of the first element in the array, the type of each
         element, and the number of elements.

         The array index is indicated rather indirectly, in a way
         which makes optimisation easy: as the sum of variable part
         (the 'ix' field) and a constant offset (the 'bias' field).

         Since the indexing is circular, the actual array index to use
         is computed as (ix + bias) % num-of-elems-in-the-array.

         Here's an example.  The description

            (96:8xF64)[t39,-7]

         describes an array of 8 F64-typed values, the
         guest-state-offset of the first being 96.  This array is
         being indexed at (t39 - 7) % 8.

         It is important to get the array size/type exactly correct
         since IR optimisation looks closely at such info in order to
         establish aliasing/non-aliasing between seperate GetI and
         PutI events, which is used to establish when they can be
         reordered, etc.  Putting incorrect info in will lead to
         obscure IR optimisation bugs.

         With the 'cee' field, 'name' is the function's name.  It is
         only used for pretty-printing purposes.  The address to call
         (host address, of course) is stored in the 'addr' field
         inside 'cee'.

         The 'args' field is a NULL-terminated array of arguments.
         The stated return IRType, and the implied argument types,
         must match that of the function being called well enough so
         that the back end can actually generate correct code for the
         call.

         The called function **must** satisfy the following:

         * no side effects -- must be a pure function, the result of
           which depends only on the passed parameters.

         * it may not look at, nor modify, any of the guest state
           since that would hide guest state transitions from
           instrumenters

         * it may not access guest memory, since that would hide
           guest memory transactions from the instrumenters

         * it must not assume that arguments are being evaluated in a
           particular order. The oder of evaluation is unspecified.

         This is restrictive, but makes the semantics clean, and does
         not interfere with IR optimisation.

         If you want to call a helper which can mess with guest state
         and/or memory, instead use Ist_Dirty.  This is a lot more
         flexible, but you have to give a bunch of details about what
         the helper does (and you better be telling the truth,
         otherwise any derived instrumentation will be wrong).  Also
         Ist_Dirty inhibits various IR optimisations and so can cause
         quite poor code to be generated.  Try to avoid it.

         In principle it would be allowable to have the arg vector
         contain an IRExpr_VECRET(), although not IRExpr_GSPTR(). However,
         at the moment there is no requirement for clean helper calls to
         be able to return V128 or V256 values.  Hence this is not allowed.

   Re Ijk_InvalICache and Ijk_FlushDCache: the guest state _must_ have
   two pseudo-registers, guest_CMSTART and guest_CMLEN, which specify
   the start and length of the region to be invalidated.  CM stands
   for "Cache Management".  These are both the size of a guest word.
   It is the responsibility of the relevant toIR.c to ensure that
   these are filled in with suitable values before issuing a jump of
   kind Ijk_InvalICache or Ijk_FlushDCache.

   Ijk_InvalICache requests invalidation of translations taken from
   the requested range.  Ijk_FlushDCache requests flushing of the D
   cache for the specified range.

   Re Ijk_EmWarn and Ijk_EmFail: the guest state must have a
   pseudo-register guest_EMNOTE, which is 32-bits regardless of the
   host or guest word size.  That register should be made to hold a
   VexEmNote value to indicate the reason for the exit.

   In the case of Ijk_EmFail, the exit is fatal (Vex-generated code
   cannot continue) and so the jump destination can be anything.

   Re Ijk_Sys_ (syscall jumps): the guest state must have a
   pseudo-register guest_IP_AT_SYSCALL, which is the size of a guest
   word.  Front ends should set this to be the IP at the most recently
   executed kernel-entering (system call) instruction.  This makes it
   very much easier (viz, actually possible at all) to back up the
   guest to restart a syscall that has been interrupted by a signal.

/* ------------------ Dirty helper calls ------------------ */

/* A dirty call is a flexible mechanism for calling (possibly
   conditionally) a helper function or procedure.  The helper function
   may read, write or modify client memory, and may read, write or
   modify client state.  It can take arguments and optionally return a
   value.  It may return different results and/or do different things
   when called repeatedly with the same arguments, by means of storing
   private state.

   If a value is returned, it is assigned to the nominated return
   temporary.

   Dirty calls are statements rather than expressions for obvious
   reasons.  If a dirty call is marked as writing guest state, any
   pre-existing values derived from the written parts of the guest
   state are invalid.  Similarly, if the dirty call is stated as
   writing memory, any pre-existing loaded values are invalidated by
   it.

   In order that instrumentation is possible, the call must state, and
   state correctly:

   * Whether it reads, writes or modifies memory, and if so where.

   * Whether it reads, writes or modifies guest state, and if so which
     pieces.  Several pieces may be stated, and their extents must be
     known at translation-time.  Each piece is allowed to repeat some
     number of times at a fixed interval, if required.

   Normally, code is generated to pass just the args to the helper.
   However, if IRExpr_GSPTR() is present in the argument list (at most
   one instance is allowed), then the guest state pointer is passed for
   that arg, so that the callee can access the guest state.  It is
   invalid for .nFxState to be zero but IRExpr_GSPTR() to be present,
   since .nFxState==0 is a claim that the call does not access guest
   state.

   IMPORTANT NOTE re GUARDS: Dirty calls are strict, very strict.  The
   arguments and 'mFx' are evaluated REGARDLESS of the guard value.
   The order of argument evaluation is unspecified.  The guard
   expression is evaluated AFTER the arguments and 'mFx' have been
   evaluated.  'mFx' is expected (by Memcheck) to be a defined value
   even if the guard evaluates to false.

/* --------------- Compare and Swap --------------- */

/* This denotes an atomic compare and swap operation, either
   a single-element one or a double-element one.

   In the single-element case:

     .addr is the memory address.
     .end  is the endianness with which memory is accessed

     If .addr contains the same value as .expdLo, then .dataLo is
     written there, else there is no write.  In both cases, the
     original value at .addr is copied into .oldLo.

     Types: .expdLo, .dataLo and .oldLo must all have the same type.
     It may be any integral type, viz: I8, I16, I32 or, for 64-bit
     guests, I64.

     .oldHi must be IRTemp_INVALID, and .expdHi and .dataHi must
     be NULL.

   In the double-element case:

     .addr is the memory address.
     .end  is the endianness with which memory is accessed

     The operation is the same:

     If .addr contains the same value as .expdHi:.expdLo, then
     .dataHi:.dataLo is written there, else there is no write.  In
     both cases the original value at .addr is copied into
     .oldHi:.oldLo.

     Types: .expdHi, .expdLo, .dataHi, .dataLo, .oldHi, .oldLo must
     all have the same type, which may be any integral type, viz: I8,
     I16, I32 or, for 64-bit guests, I64.

     The double-element case is complicated by the issue of
     endianness.  In all cases, the two elements are understood to be
     located adjacently in memory, starting at the address .addr.

       If .end is Iend_LE, then the .xxxLo component is at the lower
       address and the .xxxHi component is at the higher address, and
       each component is itself stored little-endianly.

       If .end is Iend_BE, then the .xxxHi component is at the lower
       address and the .xxxLo component is at the higher address, and
       each component is itself stored big-endianly.

   This allows representing more cases than most architectures can
   handle.  For example, x86 cannot do DCAS on 8- or 16-bit elements.

   How to know if the CAS succeeded?

   * if .oldLo == .expdLo (resp. .oldHi:.oldLo == .expdHi:.expdLo),
     then the CAS succeeded, .dataLo (resp. .dataHi:.dataLo) is now
     stored at .addr, and the original value there was .oldLo (resp
     .oldHi:.oldLo).

   * if .oldLo != .expdLo (resp. .oldHi:.oldLo != .expdHi:.expdLo),
     then the CAS failed, and the original value at .addr was .oldLo
     (resp. .oldHi:.oldLo).

   Hence it is easy to know whether or not the CAS succeeded.

/* Conditional loads are a little more complex.  'addr' is the
   address, 'guard' is the guarding condition.  If the load takes
   place, the loaded value is placed in 'dst'.  If it does not take
   place, 'alt' is copied to 'dst'.  However, the loaded value is not
   placed directly in 'dst' -- it is first subjected to the conversion
   specified by 'cvt'.

   For example, imagine doing a conditional 8-bit load, in which the
   loaded value is zero extended to 32 bits.  Hence:
   * 'dst' and 'alt' must have type I32
   * 'cvt' must be a unary op which converts I8 to I32.  In this 
     example, it would be ILGop_8Uto32.

   There is no explicit indication of the type at which the load is
   done, since that is inferrable from the arg type of 'cvt'.  Note
   that the types of 'alt' and 'dst' and the result type of 'cvt' must
   all be the same.

   Semantically, 'addr' is evaluated even in the case where 'guard'
   evaluates to zero (false), and 'alt' is evaluated even when 'guard'
   evaluates to one (true).  That is, 'addr' and 'alt' are always
   evaluated.

         /* Either Load-Linked or Store-Conditional, depending on
            STOREDATA.

            If STOREDATA is NULL then this is a Load-Linked, meaning
            that data is loaded from memory as normal, but a
            'reservation' for the address is also lodged in the
            hardware.

               result = Load-Linked(addr, end)

            The data transfer type is the type of RESULT (I32, I64,
            etc).  ppIRStmt output:

               result = LD<end>-Linked(<addr>), eg. LDbe-Linked(t1)

            If STOREDATA is not NULL then this is a Store-Conditional,
            hence:

               result = Store-Conditional(addr, storedata, end)

            The data transfer type is the type of STOREDATA and RESULT
            has type Ity_I1. The store may fail or succeed depending
            on the state of a previously lodged reservation on this
            address.  RESULT is written 1 if the store succeeds and 0
            if it fails.  eg ppIRStmt output:

               result = ( ST<end>-Cond(<addr>) = <storedata> )
               eg t3 = ( STbe-Cond(t1, t2) )

            In all cases, the address must be naturally aligned for
            the transfer type -- any misaligned addresses should be
            caught by a dominating IR check and side exit.  This
            alignment restriction exists because on at least some
            LL/SC platforms (ppc), stwcx. etc will trap w/ SIGBUS on
            misaligned addresses, and we have to actually generate
            stwcx. on the host, and we don't want it trapping on the
            host.

            Summary of rules for transfer type:
              STOREDATA == NULL (LL):
                transfer type = type of RESULT
              STOREDATA != NULL (SC):
                transfer type = type of STOREDATA, and RESULT :: Ity_I1
