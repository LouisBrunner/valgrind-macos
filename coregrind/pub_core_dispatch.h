// PURPOSE: This module contains the inner loop of the execution
// mechanism, which is: find next basic block, execute it, repeat until
// the next bb isn't found in the fast-cache; or if the current bb
// exited with a request for some special action before continuing; or
// if the current thread has used up its scheduling quantum.

/* Run translations, with the given guest state, and starting by
   running the host code at 'host_addr'.  It is almost always the case
   that host_addr is the translation for guest_state.guest_IP, that
   is, host_addr is what it would be if we looked up the address of
   the translation corresponding to guest_state.guest_IP.

   The only case where this isn't true is where we're running a
   no-redir translation.  In this case host_addr is the address of the
   alternative (non-redirected) translation for guest_state.guest_IP.

   The return value must indicate why it returned back to the scheduler.
   It can also be exited if the executing code throws a non-resumable
   signal, for example SIGSEGV, in which case control longjmp()s back past
   here.

   two_words holds the return values (two words).  First is
   a TRC value.  Second is generally unused, except in the case
   where we have to return a chain-me request.
