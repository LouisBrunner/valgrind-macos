     possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
   still reachable: x bytes in 7 blocks
                      of which reachable via heuristic:
                        length64           : x bytes in 1 blocks

                        multipleinheritance: x bytes in 2 blocks
Reachable blocks (those to which a pointer was found) are not shown.
